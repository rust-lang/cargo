    <h1 class="title">Replacing sources</h1>
    <p>Cargo supports the ability to <strong>replace one source with another</strong> to express
strategies along the lines of mirrors or vendoring dependencies. Configuration
is currently done through the <a href="config.html"><code>.cargo/config</code> configuration</a> mechanism,
like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml"># The `source` table is where all keys related to source-replacement
# are stored.
[source]

# Under the `source` table are a number of other tables whose keys are a
# name for the relevant source. For example this section defines a new
# source, called `my-awesome-source`, which comes from a directory
# located at `vendor` relative to the directory containing this `.cargo/config`
# file
[source.my-awesome-source]
directory = &quot;vendor&quot;

# The crates.io default source for crates is available under the name
# &quot;crates-io&quot;, and here we use the `replace-with` key to indicate that it&#39;s
# replaced with our source above.
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = &quot;my-awesome-source&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration Cargo attempts to look up all crates in the directory
&quot;vendor&quot; rather than querying the online registry at crates.io. Using source
replacement Cargo can express:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vendoring - custom sources can be defined which represent crates on the local
filesystem. These sources are subsets of the source that they&#39;re replacing and
can be checked into projects if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Mirroring - sources can be replaced with an equivalent version which acts as a
cache for crates.io itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cargo has a core assumption about source replacement that the source code is
exactly the same from both sources. In our above example Cargo assumes that all
of the crates coming from <code>my-awesome-source</code> are the exact same as the copies
from <code>crates-io</code>. Note that this also means that <code>my-awesome-source</code> is not
allowed to have crates which are not present in the <code>crates-io</code> source.</p>

<p>As a consequence, source replacement is not appropriate for situations such as
patching a dependency or a private registry. Cargo supports patching
dependencies through the usage of <a href="manifest.html#the-replace-section">the <code>[replace]</code> key</a>, and
private registry support is planned for a future version of Cargo.</p>

<h2 id='configuration' class='section-header'><a href='#configuration'>Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Configuration of replacement sources is done through <a href="config.html"><code>.cargo/config</code></a>
and the full set of available keys are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml"># Each source has its own table where the key is the name of the source
[source.the-source-name]

# Indicate that `the-source-name` will be replaced with `another-source`,
# defined elsewhere
replace-with = &quot;another-source&quot;

# Available kinds of sources that can be specified (described below)
registry = &quot;https://example.com/path/to/index&quot;
local-registry = &quot;path/to/registry&quot;
directory = &quot;path/to/vendor&quot;

# Git sources can optionally specify a branch/tag/rev as well
git = &quot;https://example.com/path/to/repo&quot;
# branch = &quot;master&quot;
# tag = &quot;v1.0.1&quot;
# rev = &quot;313f44e8&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>crates-io</code> represents the crates.io online registry (default source of
crates) and can be replaced with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[source.crates-io]
replace-with = &#39;another-source&#39;
</code></pre>

<h2 id='registry-sources' class='section-header'><a href='#registry-sources'>Registry Sources</a></h2>
<p>A &quot;registry source&quot; is one that is the same as crates.io itself. That is, it has
an index served in a git repository which matches the format of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index">crates.io index</a>. That repository
then has configuration indicating where to download crates from.</p>

<p>Currently there is not an already-available project for setting up a mirror of
crates.io. Stay tuned though!</p>

<h2 id='local-registry-sources' class='section-header'><a href='#local-registry-sources'>Local Registry Sources</a></h2>
<p>A &quot;local registry source&quot; is intended to be a subset of another registry
source, but available on the local filesystem (aka vendoring). Local registries
are downloaded ahead of time, typically sync&#39;d with a <code>Cargo.lock</code>, and are
made up of a set of <code>*.crate</code> files and an index like the normal registry is.</p>

<p>The primary way to manage and crate local registry sources is through the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-local-registry"><code>cargo-local-registry</code></a> subcommand, available on
crates.io and can be installed with <code>cargo install cargo-local-registry</code>.</p>

<p>Local registries are contained within one directory and contain a number of
<code>*.crate</code> files downloaded from crates.io as well as an <code>index</code> directory with
the same format as the crates.io-index project (populated with just entries for
the crates that are present).</p>

<h2 id='directory-sources' class='section-header'><a href='#directory-sources'>Directory Sources</a></h2>
<p>A &quot;directory source&quot; is similar to a local registry source where it contains a
number of crates available on the local filesystem, suitable for vendoring
dependencies. Also like local registries, directory sources can primarily be
managed by an external subcommand, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-vendor"><code>cargo-vendor</code></a>, which can be
installed with <code>cargo install cargo-vendor</code>.</p>

<p>Directory sources are distinct from local registries though in that they contain
the unpacked version of <code>*.crate</code> files, making it more suitable in some
situations to check everything into source control. A directory source is just a
directory containing a number of other directories which contain the source code
for crates (the unpacked version of <code>*.crate</code> files). Currently no restriction
is placed on the name of each directory.</p>

<p>Each crate in a directory source also has an associated metadata file indicating
the checksum of each file in the crate to protect against accidental
modifications.</p>
