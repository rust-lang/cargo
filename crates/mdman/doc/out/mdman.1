.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Converts a markdown file to a man page.
.sp
The source file is first processed as a
\fIhandlebars\fR <https://handlebarsjs.com/> template. Then, it is processed as
markdown into the target format. This supports different output formats,
such as troff or plain text.
.sp
Every man page should start with a level\-1 header with the man name and
section, such as \fB# mdman(1)\fR\&.
.sp
The handlebars template has several special tags to assist with generating the
man page:

.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Every block of command\-line options must be wrapped between \fB{{#options}}\fR
and \fB{{/options}}\fR tags. This tells the processor where the options start
and end.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Each option must be expressed with a \fB{{#option}}\fR block. The parameters to
the block are a sequence of strings indicating the option. For example,
\fB{{#option "`\-p` _spec_..." "`\-\-package` _spec_..."}}\fR is an option that
has two different forms. The text within the string is processed as markdown.
It is recommended to use formatting similar to this example.
.sp
The content of the \fB{{#option}}\fR block should contain a detailed description
of the option.
.sp
Use the \fB{{/option}}\fR tag to end the option block.

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'References to other man pages should use the \fB{{man name section}}\fR
expression. For example, \fB{{man "mdman" 1}}\fR will generate a reference to
the \fBmdman(1)\fR man page. For non\-troff output, the \fB\-\-man\fR option will tell
\fBmdman\fR how to create links to the man page. If there is no matching \fB\-\-man\fR
option, then it links to a file named \fIname\fR\fB\&.md\fR in the same directory.

be used.
