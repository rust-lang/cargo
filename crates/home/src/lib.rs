//! Canonical definitions of `home_dir`, `cargo_home`, and `rustup_home`.
//!
//! The definition of `home_dir` provided by the standard library is
//! incorrect because it considers the `HOME` environment variable on
//! Windows. This causes surprising situations where a Rust program
//! will behave differently depending on whether it is run under a
//! Unix emulation environment like Cygwin or MinGW. Neither Cargo nor
//! rustup use the standard libraries definition - they use the
//! definition here.
//!
//! This crate provides two additional functions, `cargo_home` and
//! `rustup_home`, which are the canonical way to determine the
//! location that Cargo and rustup use to store their data.
//! The `env` module contains utilities for mocking the process environment
//! by Cargo and rustup.
//!
//! See also this [discussion].
//!
//! > This crate is maintained by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and Rustup
//! > and not intended for external use. This
//! > crate may make major changes to its APIs or be deprecated without warning.
