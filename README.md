# Cargo

Cargo downloads your Rust project’s dependencies and compiles your project.

**To start using Cargo**, learn more at [The Cargo Book].

**To start developing Cargo itself**, read the [Cargo Contributor Guide].

> The Cargo binary distributed through with Rust is maintained by the Cargo
> team for use by the wider ecosystem.
> For all other uses of this crate (as a binary or library) this is maintained
> by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo and not intended for external
> use (except as a transitive dependency). This crate may make major changes to
> its APIs.

## Code Status

[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Code documentation: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/>

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Cargo requires the following tools and packages to build:

* `cargo` and `rustc`
* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)
* `git` (to clone this repository)

**Other requirements:**

The following are optional based on your platform and needs.

* `pkg-config` — This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.
* OpenSSL — Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.

  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.

  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.
  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.

  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.

  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.

  LibreSSL is also supported.

**Optional system libraries:**

The build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries. However, if they are provided by the system and can be found with `pkg-config`, then the system libraries will be used instead:

* [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/) — Used for network transfers.
* [`libgit2`](https://libgit2.org/) — Used for fetching git dependencies.
* [`libssh2`](https://www.libssh2.org/) — Used for SSH access to git repositories.
* [`libz`](https://zlib.net/) (AKA zlib) — Used by the above C libraries for data compression. (Rust code uses [`zlib-rs`](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/zlib-rs) instead.)

It is recommended to use the vendored versions as they are the versions that are tested to work with Cargo.

### Compiling

First, you'll want to check out this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo.git
cd cargo
```

With `cargo` already installed, you can simply run:

```
cargo build --release
```

## Adding new subcommands to Cargo

Cargo is designed to be extensible with new subcommands without having to modify
Cargo itself. See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and
a list of known community-developed subcommands.
