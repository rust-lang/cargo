    <h1 class="title">The Manifest Format</h1>
    
<h1 id="the-[package]-section" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-[package]-section">The <code>[package]</code> Section</a></h1>
<p>The first section in a <code>Cargo.toml</code> is <code>[package]</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_world&quot; # the name of the package
version = &quot;0.0.1&quot;    # the current version, obeying semver
authors = [ &quot;you@example.com&quot; ]
</code></pre>

<p>All three of these fields are mandatory. Cargo bakes in the concept of
<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, so make sure you follow some
basic rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before you reach 1.0.0, anything goes.</li>
<li>After 1.0.0, only make breaking changes when you increment the major
version. In Rust, breaking changes include adding fields to structs or
variants to enums. Don&#39;t break the build.</li>
<li>After 1.0.0, don&#39;t add any new public API (no new <code>pub</code> anything) in
tiny versions. Always increment the minor version if you add any new
<code>pub</code> structs, traits, fields, types, functions, methods or anything else.</li>
<li>Use version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-build-field-(optional)" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-build-field-(optional)">The <code>build</code> Field (optional)</a></h2>
<p>This field specifies a file in the repository which is a <a href="build-script.html">build
script</a> for building native code. More information can be
found in the build script <a href="build-script.html">guide</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
build = &quot;build.rs&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-exclude-field-(optional)" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-exclude-field-(optional)">The <code>exclude</code> Field (optional)</a></h2>
<p>You can explicitly specify to Cargo that a set of globs should be ignored for
the purposes of packaging and rebuilding a package. The globs specified in this
field identify a set of files that are not included when a package is published
as well as ignored for the purposes of detecting when to rebuild a package.</p>

<p>If a VCS is being used for a package, the <code>exclude</code> field will be seeded with
the VCS&#39;s ignore settings (<code>.gitignore</code> for git for example).</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
exclude = [&quot;build/**/*.o&quot;, &quot;doc/**/*.html&quot;]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="package-metadata" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#package-metadata">Package metadata</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of optional metadata fields also accepted under the
<code>[package]</code> section:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...

# A short blurb about the package. This is not rendered in any format when
# uploaded to crates.io (aka this is not markdown)
description = &quot;...&quot;

# These URLs point to more information about the repository
documentation = &quot;...&quot;
homepage = &quot;...&quot;
repository = &quot;...&quot;

# This points to a file in the repository (relative to this Cargo.toml). The
# contents of this file are stored and indexed in the registry.
readme = &quot;...&quot;

# This is a small list of keywords used to categorize and search for this
# package.
keywords = [&quot;...&quot;, &quot;...&quot;]

# This is a string description of the license for this package. Currently
# crates.io will validate the license provided against a whitelist of known
# license identifiers from http://spdx.org/licenses/. Multiple licenses can
# be separated with a `/`
license = &quot;...&quot;

# If a project is using a nonstandard license, then this key may be specified in
# lieu of the above key and must point to a file relative to this manifest
# (similar to the readme key)
license-file = &quot;...&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> registry will render the description, display
the license, link to the three URLs and categorize by the keywords. These keys
provide useful information to users of the registry and also influence the
search ranking of a crate. It is highly discouraged to omit everything in a
published crate.</p>

<h1 id="the-[dependencies.*]-sections" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-[dependencies.*]-sections">The <code>[dependencies.*]</code> Sections</a></h1>
<p>You list dependencies using <code>[dependencies.&lt;name&gt;]</code>. For example, if you
wanted to depend on both <code>hammer</code> and <code>color</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...

[dependencies.hammer]
version = &quot;0.5.0&quot; # optional
git = &quot;https://github.com/wycats/hammer.rs&quot;

[dependencies.color]
git = &quot;https://github.com/bjz/color-rs&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>You can specify the source of a dependency in one of two ways at the moment:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git = &quot;&lt;git-url&gt;&quot;</code>: A git repository with a <code>Cargo.toml</code> in its root. The
<code>rev</code>, <code>tag</code>, and <code>branch</code> options are also recognized to use something other
than the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
<li><code>path = &quot;&lt;relative-path&gt;&quot;</code>: A path relative to the current <code>Cargo.toml</code>
with a <code>Cargo.toml</code> in its root.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dependencies from crates.io are not declared with separate sections:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hammer = &quot;0.5.0&quot;
color = &quot;0.6.0&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax of the requirement strings is described in the <a href="crates-io.html#using-crates.io-based-crates">crates.io guide</a>.</p>

<p>Platform-specific dependencies take the same format, but are listed under the
<code>target.$triple</code> section:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.dependencies]
openssl = &quot;1.0.1&quot;

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.dependencies]
winhttp = &quot;0.4.0&quot;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="the-[profile.*]-sections" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-[profile.*]-sections">The <code>[profile.*]</code> Sections</a></h1>
<p>Cargo supports custom configuration of how rustc is invoked through <strong>profiles</strong>
at the top level. Any manifest may declare a profile, but only the <strong>top level</strong>
project&#39;s profiles are actually read. All dependencies&#39; profiles will be
overridden. This is done so the top-level project has control over how its
dependencies are compiled.</p>

<p>There are five currently supported profile names, all of which have the same
configuration available to them. Listed below is the configuration available,
along with the defaults for each profile.</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml"># The development profile, used for `cargo build`
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0  # Controls the --opt-level the compiler builds with
debug = true   # Controls whether the compiler passes -g or `--cfg ndebug`
rpath = false  # Controls whether the compiler passes `-C rpath`
lto = false    # Controls `-C lto` for binaries and staticlibs

# The release profile, used for `cargo build --release`
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
debug = false
rpath = false
lto = false

# The testing profile, used for `cargo test`
[profile.test]
opt-level = 0
debug = true
rpath = false
lto = false

# The benchmarking profile, used for `cargo bench`
[profile.bench]
opt-level = 3
debug = false
rpath = false
lto = false

# The documentation profile, used for `cargo doc`
[profile.doc]
opt-level = 0
debug = true
rpath = false
lto = false
</code></pre>

<h1 id="the-[features]-section" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-[features]-section">The <code>[features]</code> Section</a></h1>
<p>Cargo supports <strong>features</strong> to allow expression of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optional dependencies, which enhance a package, but are not required</li>
<li>Clusters of optional dependencies, such as &quot;postgres&quot;, that would include the
<code>postgres</code> package, the <code>postgres-macros</code> package, and possibly other packages
(such as development-time mocking libraries, debugging tools, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A feature of a package is either an optional dependency, or a set of other
features. The format for specifying features is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;awesome&quot;

[features]

# The &quot;default&quot; set of optional packages. Most people will
# want to use these packages, but they are strictly optional.
# Note that `session` is not a package but rather another
# feature listed in this manifest.
default = [&quot;jquery&quot;, &quot;uglifier&quot;, &quot;session&quot;]

# The &quot;secure-password&quot; feature depends on the bcrypt package.
# This aliasing will allow people to talk about the feature in
# a higher-level way and allow this package to add more
# requirements to the feature in the future.
secure-password = [&quot;bcrypt&quot;]

# Features can be used to reexport features of other packages.
# The `session` feature of package `awesome` will ensure that the
# `session` feature of the package `cookie` is also enabled.
session = [&quot;cookie/session&quot;]

[dependencies]

# These packages are mandatory and form the core of this
# package&#39;s distribution
cookie = &quot;1.2.0&quot;
oauth = &quot;1.1.0&quot;
route-recognizer = &quot;=2.1.0&quot;

# A list of all of the optional dependencies, some of which
# are included in the above &quot;features&quot;. They can be opted
# into by apps.
[dependencies.jquery]
version = &quot;1.0.2&quot;
optional = true

[dependencies.uglifier]
version = &quot;1.5.3&quot;
optional = true

[dependencies.bcrypt]
version = &quot;*&quot;
optional = true

[dependencies.civet]
version = &quot;*&quot;
optional = true
</code></pre>

<p>To use the package <code>awesome</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies.awesome]
version = &quot;1.3.5&quot;
features = [&quot;secure-password&quot;, &quot;civet&quot;]

# do not include the default features, and optionally
# cherry-pick individual features
default-features = false
</code></pre>

<h2 id="rules" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#rules">Rules</a></h2>
<p>The usage of features is subject to a few rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Feature names must not conflict with other package names in the manifest.
This is because they are opted into via <code>features = [...]</code>, which only has a
single namespace</li>
<li>With the exception of the <code>default</code> feature, all features are opt-in. To opt
out of the default feature, use <code>default-features = false</code> and cherry-pick
individual features.</li>
<li>Feature groups are not allowed to cyclicly depend on one another.</li>
<li>Dev-dependencies cannot be optional</li>
<li>Features groups can only reference optional dependencies</li>
<li>When a feature is selected, Cargo will call <code>rustc</code> with
<code>--cfg feature=&quot;${feature_name}&quot;</code>. If a feature group is included,
it and all of its individual features will be included. This can be
tested in code via <code>#[cfg(feature = &quot;foo&quot;)]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that it is explicitly allowed for features to not actually activate any
optional dependencies. This allows packages to internally enable/disable
features without requiring a new dependency.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-end-products" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#usage-in-end-products">Usage In End Products</a></h2>
<p>One major use-case for this feature is specifying optional features in
end-products. For example, the Servo project may want to include optional
features that people can enable or disable when they build it.</p>

<p>In that case, Servo will describe features in its <code>Cargo.toml</code> and they can be
enabled using command-line flags:</p>
<pre id='rust-example-rendered' class='rust '>
$ <span class='ident'>cargo</span> <span class='ident'>build</span> <span class='op'>-</span><span class='op'>-</span><span class='ident'>release</span> <span class='op'>-</span><span class='op'>-</span><span class='ident'>features</span> <span class='string'>&quot;shumway pdf&quot;</span>
</pre>

<p>Default features could be excluded using <code>--no-default-features</code>.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-packages" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#usage-in-packages">Usage In Packages</a></h2>
<p>In most cases, the concept of &quot;optional dependency&quot; in a library is best
expressed as a separate package that the top-level application depends on.</p>

<p>However, high-level packages, like Iron or Piston, may want the ability to
curate a number of packages for easy installation. The current Cargo system
allows them to curate a number of mandatory dependencies into a single package
for easy installation.</p>

<p>In some cases, packages may want to provide additional curation for <strong>optional</strong>
dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grouping a number of low-level optional dependencies together into a single
high-level &quot;feature&quot;.</li>
<li>Specifying packages that are recommended (or suggested) to be included by
users of the package.</li>
<li>Including a feature (like <code>secure-password</code> in the motivating example) that
will only work if an optional dependency is available, and would be difficult
to implement as a separate package. For example, it may be overly difficult to
design an IO package to be completely decoupled from OpenSSL, with opt-in via
the inclusion of a separate package.</li>
</ul>

<p>In almost all cases, it is an antipattern to use these features outside of
high-level packages that are designed for curation. If a feature is optional, it
can almost certainly be expressed as a separate package.</p>

<h1 id="the-[dev-dependencies.*]-sections" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-[dev-dependencies.*]-sections">The <code>[dev-dependencies.*]</code> Sections</a></h1>
<p>The format of this section is equivalent to <code>[dependencies.*]</code>. Dev-dependencies
are not used when compiling a package for building, but are used for compiling
tests and benchmarks.</p>

<p>These dependencies are <em>not</em> propagated to other packages which depend on this
package.</p>

<h1 id="the-project-layout" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#the-project-layout">The Project Layout</a></h1>
<p>If your project is an executable, name the main source file <code>src/main.rs</code>.
If it is a library, name the main source file <code>src/lib.rs</code>.</p>

<p>Cargo will also treat any files located in <code>src/bin/*.rs</code> as
executables.</p>

<p>When you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will compile all of these files into
the <code>target</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">▾ src/          # directory containing source files
  ▾ bin/        # (optional) directory containing executables
    *.rs
  lib.rs        # the main entry point for libraries and packages
  main.rs       # the main entry point for projects producing executables
▾ examples/     # (optional) examples
  *.rs
▾ tests/        # (optional) integration tests
  *.rs
▾ benches/      # (optional) benchmarks
  *.rs
</code></pre>

<h1 id="examples" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#examples">Examples</a></h1>
<p>Files located under <code>examples</code> are example uses of the functionality
provided by the library.  When compiled, they are placed in the
<code>target/examples</code> directory.</p>

<p>They must compile as executables (with <code>main.rs</code>) and load in the
library by using <code>extern crate &lt;library-name&gt;</code>. They are compiled when
you run your tests to protect them from bitrotting.</p>

<h1 id="tests" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#tests">Tests</a></h1>
<p>When you run <code>cargo test</code>, Cargo will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compile your library&#39;s unit tests, which are in files reachable from
<code>lib.rs</code>. Any sections marked with <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> will be included.</li>
<li>Compile your library&#39;s integration tests, which are located in
<code>tests</code>. Files in <code>tests</code> load in your library by using <code>extern crate
&lt;library-name&gt;</code> like any other code that depends on it.</li>
<li>Compile your library&#39;s examples.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="configuring-a-target" class='section-header'><a

<p>All of the  <code>[[bin]]</code>, <code>[lib]</code>, <code>[[bench]]</code>, and <code>[[test]]</code> sections support
similar configuration for specifying how a target should be built. The example
below uses <code>[lib]</code>, but it also applies to all other sections as well. All
values listed are the defaults for that option unless otherwise specified.</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
