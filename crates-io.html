    <h1 class="title">Cargo and crates.io</h1>
    <p>In addition to using dependencies from git repositories (as mentioned in
<a href="guide.html">the guide</a>) Cargo can also publish to and download from the
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> central repository. This site serves as a location to
discover and download packages, and <code>cargo</code> is configured to use it by default
to find requested packages.</p>

<p>The guide will explain how crates can use crates.io through the <code>cargo</code> command
line tool.</p>

<h1 id="using-crates.io-based-crates" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#using-crates.io-based-crates">Using crates.io-based crates</a></h1>
<p>The method of specifying a dependency on a crate from crates.io is slightly
different than the method of specifying a dependency on a git repository. The
syntax for doing so is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
glob = &quot;0.0.3&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>With this format, adding new dependencies should just add a new line, you don&#39;t
need to add <code>[dependencies]</code> for each dependency listed, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
glob = &quot;0.0.3&quot;
num = &quot;0.0.4&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The string value for each key in this table is a <a href="http://semver.org/">semver</a>
version requirement. The exact syntax can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/semver">rust-lang/semver</a> repository, and many of
the requirement strings can also be found documented <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.html">with
npm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Caret requirements</strong> allow SemVer compatible updates to a specified version,
<code>0.1</code> and <code>0.2</code> are not considered compatible, but <code>1.0</code> and <code>1.1</code> are for
example. If no operator is specified, this is the default requirement (e.g.
<code>1.3</code> is the same as <code>^1.3</code>).</p>

<p><code>0.0.x</code> is not considered compatible with any other version.
Missing minor and patch versions are desugared to <code>0</code> but allow flexibility for
that value.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">^1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;2.0.0
^0.2.3 := &gt;=0.2.3 &lt;0.3.0
^0.0.3 := &gt;=0.0.3 &lt;0.0.4
^0.0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;0.1.0
^0 := &gt;=0.0.0 &lt;1.0.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Tilde requirements</strong> specify a minimal version with some updates:</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">~1.2.3 := &gt;=1.2.3 &lt;1.3.0
~1.2 := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
~1 := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Wildcard requirements</strong> allows parsing of version requirements of the formats
<code>*</code>, <code>x.*</code> and <code>x.y.*</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">* := &gt;=0.0.0
1.* := &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0
1.2.* := &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;1.3.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Inequality requirements</strong> allow manually specifying a version range or an
exact version to depend on.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">&gt;= 1.2.0
&gt; 1
&lt; 2
= 1.2.3
</code></pre>

<p>Multiple version requirements can also be separated with a comma, e.g. <code>&gt;= 1.2,
&lt; 1.5</code>.</p>

<h1 id="publishing-crates" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#publishing-crates">Publishing crates</a></h1>
<p>Ok, now that we&#39;ve got a crate which is using dependencies from crates.io,
let&#39;s publish it! Publishing a crate is when a specific version is uploaded to
crates.io.</p>

<p>Take care when publishing a crate, because a publish is <strong>permanent</strong>. The
version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. There is no
limit to the number of versions which can be published, however.</p>

<h2 id="acquiring-an-api-token" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#acquiring-an-api-token">Acquiring an API token</a></h2>
<p>First thing&#39;s first, you&#39;ll need an account on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> to acquire
an API token. To do so, <a href="https://crates.io/">visit the home page</a> and log in via a GitHub
account (required for now). After this, visit your <a href="https://crates.io/me">Account
Settings</a> page and run the <code>cargo login</code> command
specified.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
</code></pre>

<p>This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in your
<code>~/.cargo/config</code>. Note that this token is a <strong>secret</strong> and should not be shared
with anyone else. If it leaks for any reason, you should regenerate it
immediately.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-a-crate" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#packaging-a-crate">Packaging a crate</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to package up your crate into a format that can be uploaded to
crates.io. For this we&#39;ll use the <code>cargo package</code> subcommand. This will take
our entire crate and package it all up into a <code>*.crate</code> file in the
<code>target/package</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">$ cargo package
</code></pre>

<p>As an added bonus, the <code>*.crate</code> will be verified independently of the current
source tree. After the <code>*.crate</code> is created, it&#39;s unpacked into
<code>target/package</code> and then built from scratch to ensure that all necessary files
are there for the build to succeed. This behavior can be disabled with the
<code>--no-verify</code> flag.</p>

<p>Now&#39;s a good time to take a look at the <code>*.crate</code> file to make sure you didn&#39;t
accidentally package up that 2GB video asset. Cargo will automatically ignore
files ignored by your version control system when packaging, but if you want to
specify an extra set of files to ignore you can use the <code>exclude</code> key in the
manifest:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
exclude = [
    &quot;public/assets/*&quot;,
    &quot;videos/*&quot;,
]
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax of each element in this array is what
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/glob">rust-lang/glob</a> accepts. If you&#39;d rather
roll with a whitelist instead of a blacklist, Cargo also supports an <code>include</code>
key:</p>

<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
# ...
include = [
    &quot;**/*.rs&quot;,
    &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;,
]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="uploading-the-crate" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#uploading-the-crate">Uploading the crate</a></h2>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve got a <code>*.crate</code> file ready to go, it can be uploaded to
crates.io with the <code>cargo publish</code> command. And that&#39;s it, you&#39;ve now published
your first crate!</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">$ cargo publish
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#39;d like to skip the <code>cargo package</code> step, the <code>cargo publish</code> subcommand
will automatically package up the local crate if a copy isn&#39;t found already.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="manifest.html#package-metadata">metadata you can
specify</a> to ensure your crate can be discovered
more easily!</p>

<h2 id="limitations" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>There are a few limitations when publish a crate in the registry:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once a version is uploaded, it can never be overwritten. To upload a new copy
of a crate you must upload a new version.</li>
<li>Crate names are allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis. Once a crate name
is taken it cannot be used for another crate.</li>
<li>There is currently a 10MB upload size limit on <code>*.crate</code> files.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="managing-a-crates.io-based-crate" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#managing-a-crates.io-based-crate">Managing a crates.io-based crate</a></h1>
<p>Management of crates is primarily done through the command line <code>cargo</code> tool
rather than the crates.io web interface. For this, there are a few subcommands
to manage a crate.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-owner" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#cargo-owner"><code>cargo owner</code></a></h2>
<p>A crate is often not developed by only one person, or perhaps the main developer
changes over time! The owners of a crate is the only person allowed to publish
new versions of the crate, but owners may also add other owners! This subcommand
allows you to allow others to publish new versions as well as add new owners
themselves:</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">$ cargo owner --add my-buddy
$ cargo owner --remove my-buddy
</code></pre>

<p>The logins specified are the GitHub logins used by the user in question. The
owner being added must also already have logged into crates.io previously.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-yank" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#cargo-yank"><code>cargo yank</code></a></h2>
<p>Occasions may arise where you publish a version of a crate that actually ends up
being broken for one reason or another (syntax error, forgot to include a file,
etc). For situations such as this, Cargo supports a &quot;yank&quot; of a version of a
crate.</p>

<pre><code class="language-notrust">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
</code></pre>

<p>A yank <strong>does not</strong> delete any code. This feature is not intended for deleting
accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must reset
those secrets immediately.</p>

<p>The semantics of a yanked version are that no new dependencies can be created
against that version, but all existing dependencies continue to work. One of the
major goals of crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of crates that does
not change over time, and allowing deletion of a version would go against this
goal. Essentially a yank means that all projects with a <code>Cargo.lock</code> will not
break, while any future <code>Cargo.lock</code> files generated will not list the yanked
version.</p>
