//! Tests for future-incompat-report messages
//!
//! Note that these tests use the -Zfuture-incompat-test for rustc.
//! This causes rustc to treat *every* lint as future-incompatible.
//! This is done because future-incompatible lints are inherently
//! ephemeral, but we don't want to continually update these tests.
//! So we pick some random lint that will likely always be the same
//! over time.

To solve this problem, you can try the following approaches:

- If the issue is not solved by updating the dependencies, a fix has to be
implemented by those dependencies. You can help with that by notifying the
maintainers of this problem (e.g. by creating a bug report) or by proposing a
fix to the maintainers (e.g. by creating a pull request):

  - bar@1.0.0
  - Repository: https://example.com/
  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package bar@1.0.0`

- If waiting for an upstream fix is not an option, you can use the `[patch]`
section in `Cargo.toml` to use your own version of the dependency. For more
information, see:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section

[WARNING] the following packages contain code that will be rejected by a future version of Rust: big_update v1.0.0, with_updates v1.0.0, without_updates v1.0.0
[NOTE] 
To solve this problem, you can try the following approaches:


- Some affected dependencies have newer versions available.
You may want to consider updating them to a newer version to see if the issue has been fixed.

big_update v1.0.0 has the following newer versions available: 2.0.0
with_updates v1.0.0 has the following newer versions available: 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 3.0.1


- If the issue is not solved by updating the dependencies, a fix has to be
implemented by those dependencies. You can help with that by notifying the
maintainers of this problem (e.g. by creating a bug report) or by proposing a
fix to the maintainers (e.g. by creating a pull request):

  - big_update@1.0.0
  - Repository: <not found>
  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package big_update@1.0.0`

  - with_updates@1.0.0
  - Repository: <not found>
  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package with_updates@1.0.0`

  - without_updates@1.0.0
  - Repository: <not found>
  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package without_updates@1.0.0`

- If waiting for an upstream fix is not an option, you can use the `[patch]`
section in `Cargo.toml` to use your own version of the dependency. For more
information, see:

The following warnings were discovered during the build. These warnings are an
indication that the packages contain code that will become an error in a
future release of Rust. These warnings typically cover changes to close
soundness problems, unintended or undocumented behavior, or critical problems
that cannot be fixed in a backwards-compatible fashion, and are not expected
to be in wide use.

Each warning should contain a link for more information on what the warning
means and how to resolve it.
