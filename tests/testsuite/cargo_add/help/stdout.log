Add dependencies to a Cargo.toml manifest file

Usage: cargo add [OPTIONS] <DEP>[@<VERSION>] ...
       cargo add [OPTIONS] --path <PATH> ...
       cargo add [OPTIONS] --git <URL> ...

Arguments:
  [DEP_ID]...
          Reference to a package to add as a dependency
          
          You can reference a package by:
          - `<name>`, like `cargo add serde` (latest version will be used)
          - `<name>@<version-req>`, like `cargo add serde@1` or `cargo add serde@=1.0.38`

Options:
      --no-default-features
          Disable the default features

      --default-features
          Re-enable the default features

  -F, --features <FEATURES>
          Space or comma separated list of features to activate

      --optional
          Mark the dependency as optional
          
          The package name will be exposed as feature of your crate.

      --no-optional
          Mark the dependency as required
          
          The package will be removed from your features.

      --rename <NAME>
          Rename the dependency
          
          Example uses:
          - Depending on multiple versions of a crate
          - Depend on crates with the same name from different registries

      --ignore-rust-version
          Ignore `rust-version` specification in packages (unstable)

  -n, --dry-run
          Don't actually write the manifest

  -q, --quiet
          Do not print cargo log messages

  -v, --verbose...
          Use verbose output (-vv very verbose/build.rs output)

      --color <WHEN>
          Coloring: auto, always, never

      --config <KEY=VALUE>
          Override a configuration value

  -Z <FLAG>
          Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo, see 'cargo -Z help' for details

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Manifest Options:
      --manifest-path <PATH>
          Path to Cargo.toml

      --frozen
          Require Cargo.lock and cache are up to date

      --locked
          Require Cargo.lock is up to date

      --offline
          Run without accessing the network

Package Selection:
  -p, --package [<SPEC>]
          Package to modify

Source:
      --path <PATH>
          Filesystem path to local crate to add

      --git <URI>
          Git repository location
          
          Without any other information, cargo will use latest commit on the main branch.

      --branch <BRANCH>
          Git branch to download the crate from

      --tag <TAG>
          Git tag to download the crate from

      --rev <REV>
          Git reference to download the crate from
          
          This is the catch all, handling hashes to named references in remote repositories.

      --registry <NAME>
          Package registry for this dependency

Section:
      --dev
          Add as development dependency
          
          Dev-dependencies are not used when compiling a package for building, but are used for
          compiling tests, examples, and benchmarks.
          
          These dependencies are not propagated to other packages which depend on this package.

      --build
          Add as build dependency
          
          Build-dependencies are the only dependencies available for use by build scripts
          (`build.rs` files).

      --target <TARGET>
          Add as dependency to the given target platform

Run `cargo help add` for more detailed information.
