=== Feature Selection

When no feature options are given, the `default` feature is activated for
every selected package.

*--features* _FEATURES_::
    Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
    apply to the current directory's package. Features of direct dependencies
    may be enabled with `<dep-name>/<feature-name>` syntax. This flag may be
    specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.

*--all-features*::
    Activate all available features of all selected packages.

*--no-default-features*::
    Do not activate the `default` feature of the current directory's
    package.
