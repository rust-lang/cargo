OPTIONS
   Special Options
       -V, --version
           Print version info and exit. If used with --verbose, prints extra
           information.

       --list
           List all installed Cargo subcommands. If used with --verbose, prints
           extra information.

       --explain code
           Run rustc --explain CODE which will print out a detailed explanation
           of an error message (for example, E0004).

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

FILES
       ~/.cargo/
           Default location for Cargo’s “home” directory where it
       stores various files. The location can be changed with the CARGO_HOME
       environment variable.

       $CARGO_HOME/bin/
           Binaries installed by cargo-install(1) will be located here. If
       using rustup <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/>, executables
       distributed with Rust are also located here.

       $CARGO_HOME/config.toml
           The global configuration file. See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html> for more
       information about configuration files.

       .cargo/config.toml
           Cargo automatically searches for a file named .cargo/config.toml
       in the current directory, and all parent directories. These
       configuration files will be merged with the global configuration file.

       $CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml
           Private authentication information for logging in to a registry.

       $CARGO_HOME/registry/
           This directory contains cached downloads of the registry index
       and any downloaded dependencies.

       $CARGO_HOME/git/
           This directory contains cached downloads of git dependencies.

       Please note that the internal structure of the $CARGO_HOME directory is
       not stable yet and may be subject to change.

EXAMPLES
       1. Build a local package and all of its dependencies:

              cargo build

       2. Build a package with optimizations:

              cargo build --release

       3. Run tests for a cross-compiled target:

              cargo test --target i686-unknown-linux-gnu

       4. Create a new package that builds an executable:

              cargo new foobar

       5. Create a package in the current directory:

              mkdir foo && cd foo
              cargo init .

       6. Learn about a command’s options and usage:

              cargo help clean
