CARGO-UPDATE(1)

NAME
       cargo-update — Update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file

SYNOPSIS
       cargo update [options] spec

DESCRIPTION
       This command will update dependencies in the Cargo.lock file to the
       latest version. If the Cargo.lock file does not exist, it will be
       created with the latest available versions.

OPTIONS
   Update Options
       spec…
           Update only the specified packages. This flag may be specified
           multiple times. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC format.

           If packages are specified with spec, then a conservative update of
           the lockfile will be performed. This means that only the dependency
           specified by SPEC will be updated. Its transitive dependencies will
           be updated only if SPEC cannot be updated without updating
           dependencies. All other dependencies will remain locked at their
           currently recorded versions.

           If spec is not specified, all dependencies are updated.

       --recursive
           When used with spec, dependencies of spec are forced to update as
           well. Cannot be used with --precise.

       --precise precise
           When used with spec, allows you to specify a specific version number
           to set the package to. If the package comes from a git repository,
           this can be a git revision (such as a SHA hash or tag).

       -w, --workspace
           Attempt to update only packages defined in the workspace. Other
           packages are updated only if they don’t already exist in the
           lockfile. This option is useful for updating Cargo.lock after
           you’ve changed version numbers in Cargo.toml.

       --dry-run
           Displays what would be updated, but doesn’t actually write the
           lockfile.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Update all dependencies in the lockfile:

              cargo update

       2. Update only specific dependencies:

              cargo update foo bar

       3. Set a specific dependency to a specific version:

              cargo update foo --precise 1.2.3
