CARGO-YANK(1)

NAME
       cargo-yank - Remove a pushed crate from the index

SYNOPSIS
       cargo yank [options] --vers version [crate]

DESCRIPTION
       The yank command removes a previously published crate's version from the
       server's index. This command does not delete any data, and the crate
       will still be available for download via the registry's download link.

       Note that existing crates locked to a yanked version will still be able
       to download the yanked version to use it. Cargo will, however, not allow
       any new crates to be locked to any yanked version.

       This command requires you to be authenticated with either the --token
       option or using cargo-login(1).

       If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from
       the current directory.

OPTIONS
   Yank Options
       --vers version
           The version to yank or un-yank.

       --undo
           Undo a yank, putting a version back into the index.

       --token token
           API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token
           stored in the credentials file (which is created by cargo-login(1)).

           Cargo config <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>
           environment variables can be used to override the tokens stored in
           the credentials file. The token for crates.io may be specified with
           the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. Tokens for other
           registries may be specified with environment variables of the form
           CARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN where NAME is the name of the registry
           in all capital letters.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Cargo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output
           which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build
           script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose config
           value <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Yank a crate from the index:

              cargo yank --vers 1.0.7 foo
