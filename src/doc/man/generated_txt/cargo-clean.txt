CARGO-CLEAN(1)

NAME
       cargo-clean — Remove generated artifacts

SYNOPSIS
       cargo clean [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Remove artifacts from the target directory that Cargo has generated in
       the past.

       With no options, cargo clean will delete the entire target directory.

OPTIONS
   Package Selection
       When no packages are selected, all packages and all dependencies in the
       workspace are cleaned.

       -p spec…, --package spec…
           Clean only the specified packages. This flag may be specified
           multiple times. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC format.

   Clean Options
       --dry-run
           Displays a summary of what would be deleted without deleting
           anything. Use with --verbose to display the actual files that would
           be deleted.

       --doc
           This option will cause cargo clean to remove only the doc directory
           in the target directory.

       --release
           Remove all artifacts in the release directory.

       --profile name
           Remove all artifacts in the directory with the given profile name.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

       --target triple
           Clean for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple
           times.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --locked
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as
           when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated. Cargo
           will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           o  The lock file is missing.

           o  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different
              dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are
           desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --frozen
           Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline.

       --lockfile-path PATH
           Changes the path of the lockfile from the default
           (<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock) to PATH. PATH must end with Cargo.lock
           (e.g. --lockfile-path /tmp/temporary-lockfile/Cargo.lock). Note that
           providing --lockfile-path will ignore existing lockfile at the
           default path, and instead will either use the lockfile from PATH, or
           write a new lockfile into the provided PATH if it doesn’t exist.
           This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories,
           writing lockfile into the provided PATH.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #14421
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421>).

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Remove the entire target directory:

              cargo clean

       2. Remove only the release artifacts:

              cargo clean --release
