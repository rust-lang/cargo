CARGO-METADATA(1)

NAME
       cargo-metadata — Machine-readable metadata about the current package

SYNOPSIS
       cargo metadata [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Output JSON to stdout containing information about the workspace members
       and resolved dependencies of the current package.

       The output format is subject to change in future versions of Cargo. It
       is recommended to include the --format-version flag to future-proof your
       code and ensure the output is in the format you are expecting. For more
       on the expectations, see “Compatibility”.

       See the cargo_metadata crate <https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata>
       for a Rust API for reading the metadata.

OUTPUT FORMAT
   Compatibility
       Within the same output format version, the compatibility is maintained,
       except some scenarios. The following is a non-exhaustive list of changes
       that are not considered as incompatible:

       o  Adding new fields — New fields will be added when needed. Reserving
          this helps Cargo evolve without bumping the format version too often.

       o  Adding new values for enum-like fields — Same as adding new fields.
          It keeps metadata evolving without stagnation.

       o  Changing opaque representations — The inner representations of some
          fields are implementation details. For example, fields related to
          “Source ID” are treated as opaque identifiers to differentiate
          packages or sources. Consumers shouldn’t rely on those
          representations unless specified.

   JSON format
       The JSON output has the following format:

           {
               /* Array of all packages in the workspace.
                  It also includes all feature-enabled dependencies unless --no-deps is used.
               */
               "packages": [
                   {
                       /* The name of the package. */
                       "name": "my-package",
                       /* The version of the package. */
                       "version": "0.1.0",
                       /* The Package ID for referring to the
                          package within the document and as the `--package` argument to many commands
                       */
                       "id": "file:///path/to/my-package#0.1.0",

                       /* The description value from the manifest, or null. */
                       "description": "Package description.",
                       /* The source ID of the package, an "opaque" identifier representing
                          where a package is retrieved from. See "Compatibility" above for

                          This is null for path dependencies and workspace members.
           
                          For other dependencies, it is a string with the format:
                          - "registry+URL" for registry-based dependencies.
                            Example: "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
                          - "git+URL" for git-based dependencies.
                            Example: "git+https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo?rev=5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c#5e85ba14aaa20f8133863373404cb0af69eeef2c"
                          - "sparse+URL" for dependencies from a sparse registry
                            Example: "sparse+https://my-sparse-registry.org"
           
                          The value after the `+` is not explicitly defined, and may change
                          between versions of Cargo and may not directly correlate to other
                          things, such as registry definitions in a config file. New source
                          kinds may be added in the future which will have different `+`
                          prefixed identifiers.

          reference.

OPTIONS
   Output Options
       --no-deps
           Output information only about the workspace members and don’t
           fetch dependencies.

       --format-version version
           Specify the version of the output format to use. Currently 1 is the
           only possible value.

       --filter-platform triple
           This filters the resolve output to only include dependencies for the
           given target triple
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#target>.
           Without this flag, the resolve includes all targets.

           Note that the dependencies listed in the “packages” array still
           includes all dependencies. Each package definition is intended to be
           an unaltered reproduction of the information within Cargo.toml.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --locked
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as
           when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated. Cargo
           will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           o  The lock file is missing.

           o  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different
              dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are
           desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --frozen
           Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline.

       --lockfile-path PATH
           Changes the path of the lockfile from the default
           (<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock) to PATH. PATH must end with Cargo.lock
           (e.g. --lockfile-path /tmp/temporary-lockfile/Cargo.lock). Note that
           providing --lockfile-path will ignore existing lockfile at the
           default path, and instead will either use the lockfile from PATH, or
           write a new lockfile into the provided PATH if it doesn’t exist.
           This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories,
           writing lockfile into the provided PATH.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #14421
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421>).

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Output JSON about the current package:

              cargo metadata --format-version=1
