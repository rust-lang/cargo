CARGO-ADD(1)

NAME
       cargo-add — Add dependencies to a Cargo.toml manifest file

SYNOPSIS
       cargo add [options] crate…
       cargo add [options] --path path
       cargo add [options] --git url [crate…]

DESCRIPTION
       This command can add or modify dependencies.

       The source for the dependency can be specified with:

       o  crate@version: Fetch from a registry with a version constraint of
          “version”

       o  --path path: Fetch from the specified path

       o  --git url: Pull from a git repo at url

       If no source is specified, then a best effort will be made to select
       one, including:

       o  Existing dependencies in other tables (like dev-dependencies)

       o  Workspace members

       o  Latest release in the registry

       When you add a package that is already present, the existing entry will
       be updated with the flags specified.

       Upon successful invocation, the enabled (+) and disabled (-) features
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html> of the
       specified dependency will be listed in the command’s output.

OPTIONS
   Source options
       --git url
           Git URL to add the specified crate from
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories>.

       --branch branch
           Branch to use when adding from git.

       --tag tag
           Tag to use when adding from git.

       --rev sha
           Specific commit to use when adding from git.

       --path path
           Filesystem path
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-path-dependencies>
           to local crate to add.

       --base base
           The path base
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#path-bases>
           to use when adding a local crate.

           Unstable (nightly-only)
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#path-bases>

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Cargo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Section options
       --dev
           Add as a development dependency
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies>.

       --build
           Add as a build dependency
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#build-dependencies>.

       --target target
           Add as a dependency to the given target platform
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#platform-specific-dependencies>.

           To avoid unexpected shell expansions, you may use quotes around each
           target, e.g., --target 'cfg(unix)'.

   Dependency options
       --dry-run
           Don’t actually write the manifest

       --rename name
           Rename
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml>
           the dependency.

       --optional
           Mark the dependency as optional
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#optional-dependencies>.

       --no-optional
           Mark the dependency as required
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#optional-dependencies>.

       --public
           Mark the dependency as public.

           The dependency can be referenced in your library’s public API.

           Unstable (nightly-only)
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency>

       --no-public
           Mark the dependency as private.

           While you can use the crate in your implementation, it cannot be
           referenced in your public API.

           Unstable (nightly-only)
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency>

       --no-default-features
           Disable the default features
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features>.

       --default-features
           Re-enable the default features
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features>.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features>.
           When adding multiple crates, the features for a specific crate may
           be enabled with package-name/feature-name syntax. This flag may be
           specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       -p spec, --package spec
           Add dependencies to only the specified package.

       --ignore-rust-version
           Ignore rust-version specification in packages.

       --locked
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as
           when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated. Cargo
           will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           o  The lock file is missing.

           o  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different
              dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are
           desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --frozen
           Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline.

       --lockfile-path PATH
           Changes the path of the lockfile from the default
           (<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock) to PATH. PATH must end with Cargo.lock
           (e.g. --lockfile-path /tmp/temporary-lockfile/Cargo.lock). Note that
           providing --lockfile-path will ignore existing lockfile at the
           default path, and instead will either use the lockfile from PATH, or
           write a new lockfile into the provided PATH if it doesn’t exist.
           This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories,
           writing lockfile into the provided PATH.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #14421
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421>).

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Add regex as a dependency

              cargo add --dev trybuild

       3. Add an older version of nom as a dependency

              cargo add nom@5

       4. Add support for serializing data structures to json with derives

              cargo add serde serde_json -F serde/derive

       5. Add windows as a platform specific dependency on cfg(windows)

              cargo add windows --target 'cfg(windows)'
