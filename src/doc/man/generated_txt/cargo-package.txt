CARGO-PACKAGE(1)

NAME
       cargo-package — Assemble the local package into a distributable
       tarball

SYNOPSIS
       cargo package [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will create a distributable, compressed .crate file with
       the source code of the package in the current directory. The resulting
       file will be stored in the target/package directory. This performs the
       following steps:

       1. Load and check the current workspace, performing some basic checks.

          o  Path dependencies are not allowed unless they have a version key.
             Cargo will ignore the path key for dependencies in published
             packages. dev-dependencies do not have this restriction.

       2. Create the compressed .crate file.

          o  The original Cargo.toml file is rewritten and normalized.

          o  [patch], [replace], and [workspace] sections are removed from the
             manifest.

          o  Cargo.lock is always included. When missing, a new lock file will
             be generated unless the --exclude-lockfile flag is used.
             cargo-install(1) will use the packaged lock file if the --locked
             flag is used.

          o  A .cargo_vcs_info.json file is included that contains information
             about the current VCS checkout hash if available, as well as a
             flag if the worktree is dirty.

          o  Symlinks are flattened to their target files.

          o  Files and directories are included or excluded based on rules
             mentioned in the [include] and [exclude] fields
             <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields>.

       3. Extract the .crate file and build it to verify it can build.

          o  This will rebuild your package from scratch to ensure that it can
             be built from a pristine state. The --no-verify flag can be used
             to skip this step.

       4. Check that build scripts did not modify any source files.

       The list of files included can be controlled with the include and
       exclude fields in the manifest.

       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html> for more
       details about packaging and publishing.

   .cargo_vcs_info.json format
       Will generate a .cargo_vcs_info.json in the following format

           {
            "git": {
              "sha1": "aac20b6e7e543e6dd4118b246c77225e3a3a1302",
              "dirty": true
            },
            "path_in_vcs": ""
           }

       dirty indicates that the Git worktree was dirty when the package was
       built.

       path_in_vcs will be set to a repo-relative path for packages in
       subdirectories of the version control repository.

       The compatibility of this file is maintained under the same policy as
       the JSON output of cargo-metadata(1).

       Note that this file provides a best-effort snapshot of the VCS
       information. However, the provenance of the package is not verified.
       There is no guarantee that the source code in the tarball matches the
       VCS information.

OPTIONS
   Package Options
       -l, --list
           Print files included in a package without making one.

       --no-verify
           Don’t verify the contents by building them.

       --no-metadata
           Ignore warnings about a lack of human-usable metadata (such as the
           description or the license).

       --allow-dirty
           Allow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be
           packaged.

       --exclude-lockfile
           Don’t include the lock file when packaging.

           This flag is not for general use. Some tools may expect a lock file
           to be present (e.g. cargo install --locked). Consider other options
           before using this.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to package for; see cargo publish --help for
           more details about configuration of registry names. The packages
           will not be published to this registry, but if we are packaging
           multiple inter-dependent crates, lock-files will be generated under
           the assumption that dependencies will be published to this registry.

       --message-format fmt
           Specifies the output message format. Currently, it only works with
           --list and affects the file listing format. This is unstable and
           requires -Zunstable-options. Valid output formats:

           o  human (default): Display in a file-per-line format.

           o  json: Emit machine-readable JSON information about each package.
              One package per JSON line (Newline delimited JSON).
                  {
                    /* The Package ID Spec of the package. */
                    "id": "path+file:///home/foo#0.0.0",
                    /* Files of this package */
                    "files" {
                      /* Relative path in the archive file. */
                      "Cargo.toml.orig": {
                        /* Where the file is from.
                           - "generate" for file being generated during packaging
                           - "copy" for file being copied from another location.
                        */
                        "kind": "copy",
                        /* For the "copy" kind,
                           it is an absolute path to the actual file content.
                           For the "generate" kind,
                           it is the original file the generated one is based on.
                        */
                        "path": "/home/foo/Cargo.toml"
                      },
                      "Cargo.toml": {
                        "kind": "generate",
                        "path": "/home/foo/Cargo.toml"
                      },
                      "src/main.rs": {
                        "kind": "copy",
                        "path": "/home/foo/src/main.rs"
                      }
                    }
                  }

   Package Selection
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages
       selected depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current
       working directory if --manifest-path is not given). If the manifest is
       the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are
       selected, otherwise only the package defined by the manifest will be
       selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
       workspace.default-members key in the root manifest. If this is not set,
       a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing --workspace), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the
       root crate itself.

       -p spec…, --package spec…
           Package only the specified packages. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC
           format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
           common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your
           shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles
           them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around each
           pattern.

       --workspace
           Package all members in the workspace.

       --exclude SPEC…
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
           --workspace flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and
           supports common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo
           handles them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around
           each pattern.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Package for the specified target architecture. Flag may be specified
           multiple times. The default is the host architecture. The general
           format of the triple is <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>.

           Possible values:

           o  Any supported target in rustc --print target-list.

           o  "host-tuple", which will internally be substituted by the
              host’s target. This can be particularly useful if you’re
              cross-compiling some crates, and don’t want to specify your
              host’s machine as a target (for instance, an xtask in a shared
              project that may be worked on by many hosts).

           o  A path to a custom target specification. See Custom Target Lookup
              Path
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/custom.html#custom-target-lookup-path>
              for more information.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --locked
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as
           when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated. Cargo
           will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           o  The lock file is missing.

           o  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different
              dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are
           desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --frozen
           Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline.

       --lockfile-path PATH
           Changes the path of the lockfile from the default
           (<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock) to PATH. PATH must end with Cargo.lock
           (e.g. --lockfile-path /tmp/temporary-lockfile/Cargo.lock). Note that
           providing --lockfile-path will ignore existing lockfile at the
           default path, and instead will either use the lockfile from PATH, or
           write a new lockfile into the provided PATH if it doesn’t exist.
           This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories,
           writing lockfile into the provided PATH.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #14421
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421>).

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number
           of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value.
           If a string default is provided, it sets the value back to defaults.
           Should not be 0.

       --keep-going
           Build as many crates in the dependency graph as possible, rather
           than aborting the build on the first one that fails to build.

           For example if the current package depends on dependencies fails and
           works, one of which fails to build, cargo package -j1 may or may not
           build the one that succeeds (depending on which one of the two
           builds Cargo picked to run first), whereas cargo package -j1
           --keep-going would definitely run both builds, even if the one run
           first fails.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Create a compressed .crate file of the current package:

              cargo package
