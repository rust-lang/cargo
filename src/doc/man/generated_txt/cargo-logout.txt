CARGO-LOGOUT(1)

NAME
       cargo-logout — Remove an API token from the registry locally

SYNOPSIS
       cargo logout [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will run a credential provider to remove a saved token.

       For the default cargo:token credential provider, credentials are stored
       in $CARGO_HOME/credentials.toml where $CARGO_HOME defaults to .cargo in
       your home directory.

       If a registry has a credential-provider specified, it will be used.
       Otherwise, the providers from the config value
       registry.global-credential-providers will be attempted, starting from
       the end of the list.

       If --registry is not specified, then the credentials for the default
       registry will be removed (configured by registry.default
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#registrydefault>,
       which defaults to <https://crates.io/>).

       This will not revoke the token on the server. If you need to revoke the
       token, visit the registry website and follow its instructions (see
       <https://crates.io/me> to revoke the token for <https://crates.io/>).

OPTIONS
   Logout Options
       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Cargo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Remove the default registry token:

              cargo logout

       2. Remove the token for a specific registry:

              cargo logout --registry my-registry
