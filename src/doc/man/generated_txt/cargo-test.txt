CARGO-TEST(1)

NAME
       cargo-test — Execute unit and integration tests of a package

SYNOPSIS
       cargo test [options] [testname] [-- test-options]

DESCRIPTION
       Compile and execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.

       The test filtering argument TESTNAME and all the arguments following the
       two dashes (--) are passed to the test binaries and thus to libtest
       (rustc’s built in unit-test and micro-benchmarking framework). If
       you’re passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after
       -- go to the binary, the ones before go to Cargo. For details about
       libtest’s arguments see the output of cargo test -- --help and check
       out the rustc book’s chapter on how tests work at
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>.

       As an example, this will filter for tests with foo in their name and run
       them on 3 threads in parallel:

           cargo test foo -- --test-threads 3

       Tests are built with the --test option to rustc which creates a special
       executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable
       automatically runs all functions annotated with the #[test] attribute in
       multiple threads. #[bench] annotated functions will also be run with one
       iteration to verify that they are functional.

       If the package contains multiple test targets, each target compiles to a
       special executable as aforementioned, and then is run serially.

       The libtest harness may be disabled by setting harness = false in the
       target manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide
       its own main function to handle running tests.

   Documentation tests
       Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by
       rustdoc. It extracts code samples from documentation comments of the
       library target, and then executes them.

       Different from normal test targets, each code block compiles to a
       doctest executable on the fly with rustc. These executables run in
       parallel in separate processes. The compilation of a code block is in
       fact a part of test function controlled by libtest, so some options such
       as --jobs might not take effect. Note that this execution model of
       doctests is not guaranteed and may change in the future; beware of
       depending on it.

       See the rustdoc book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/> for more
       information on writing doc tests.

   Working directory of tests
       The working directory when running each unit and integration test is set
       to the root directory of the package the test belongs to. Setting the
       working directory of tests to the package’s root directory makes it
       possible for tests to reliably access the package’s files using
       relative paths, regardless from where cargo test was executed from.

       For documentation tests, the working directory when invoking rustdoc is
       set to the workspace root directory, and is also the directory rustdoc
       uses as the compilation directory of each documentation test. The
       working directory when running each documentation test is set to the
       root directory of the package the test belongs to, and is controlled via
       rustdoc’s --test-run-directory option.

OPTIONS
   Test Options
       --no-run
           Compile, but don’t run tests.

       --no-fail-fast
           Run all tests regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will
           exit after the first executable fails. The Rust test harness will
           run all tests within the executable to completion, this flag only
           applies to the executable as a whole.

   Package Selection
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages
       selected depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current
       working directory if --manifest-path is not given). If the manifest is
       the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are
       selected, otherwise only the package defined by the manifest will be
       selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
       workspace.default-members key in the root manifest. If this is not set,
       a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing --workspace), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the
       root crate itself.

       -p spec…, --package spec…
           Test only the specified packages. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC
           format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
           common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your
           shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles
           them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around each
           pattern.

       --workspace
           Test all members in the workspace.

       --all
           Deprecated alias for --workspace.

       --exclude SPEC…
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
           --workspace flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and
           supports common Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo
           handles them, you must use single quotes or double quotes around
           each pattern.

   Target Selection
       When no target selection options are given, cargo test will build the
       following targets of the selected packages:

       o  lib — used to link with binaries, examples, integration tests, and
          doc tests

       o  bins (only if integration tests are built and required features are
          available)

       o  examples — to ensure they compile

       o  lib as a unit test

       o  bins as unit tests

       o  integration tests

       o  doc tests for the lib target

       The default behavior can be changed by setting the test flag for the
       target in the manifest settings. Setting examples to test = true will
       build and run the example as a test, replacing the example’s main
       function with the libtest harness. If you don’t want the main function
       replaced, also include harness = false, in which case the example will
       be built and executed as-is.

       Setting targets to test = false will stop them from being tested by
       default. Target selection options that take a target by name (such as
       --example foo) ignore the test flag and will always test the given
       target.

       Doc tests for libraries may be disabled by setting doctest = false for
       the library in the manifest.

       See Configuring a target
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#configuring-a-target>
       for more information on per-target settings.

       Binary targets are automatically built if there is an integration test
       or benchmark being selected to test. This allows an integration test to
       execute the binary to exercise and test its behavior. The
       CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name> environment variable
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates>
       is set when the integration test is built so that it can use the env
       macro <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html> to locate the
       executable.

       Passing target selection flags will test only the specified targets.

       Note that --bin, --example, --test and --bench flags also support common
       Unix glob patterns like *, ? and []. However, to avoid your shell
       accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must
       use single quotes or double quotes around each glob pattern.

       --lib
           Test the package’s library.

       --bin name…
           Test the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times
           and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --bins
           Test all binary targets.

       --example name…
           Test the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --examples
           Test all example targets.

       --test name…
           Test the specified integration test. This flag may be specified
           multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --tests
           Test all targets in test mode that have the test = true manifest
           flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
           unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build
           any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice
           (once as a unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries,
           integration tests, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by
           setting the test flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       --bench name…
           Test the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple
           times and supports common Unix glob patterns.

       --benches
           Test all targets in benchmark mode that have the bench = true
           manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries
           built as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also
           build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built
           twice (once as a benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries,
           benchmarks, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the
           bench flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       --all-targets
           Test all targets. This is equivalent to specifying --lib --bins
           --tests --benches --examples.

       --doc
           Test only the library’s documentation. This cannot be mixed with
           other target options.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Test for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple
           times.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       -r, --release
           Test optimized artifacts with the release profile. See also the
           --profile option for choosing a specific profile by name.

       --profile name
           Test with the given profile. See the reference
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html> for more
           details on profiles.

       --ignore-rust-version
           Test the target even if the selected Rust compiler is older than the
           required Rust version as configured in the project’s rust-version
           field.

       --timings=fmts
           Output information how long each compilation takes, and track
           concurrency information over time. Accepts an optional
           comma-separated list of output formats; --timings without an
           argument will default to --timings=html. Specifying an output format
           (rather than the default) is unstable and requires
           -Zunstable-options. Valid output formats:

           o  html (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Write a
              human-readable file cargo-timing.html to the target/cargo-timings
              directory with a report of the compilation. Also write a report
              to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename if you
              want to look at older runs. HTML output is suitable for human
              consumption only, and does not provide machine-readable timing
              data.

           o  json (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Emit
              machine-readable JSON information about timing information.

   Output Options
       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Display Options
       By default the Rust test harness hides output from test execution to
       keep results readable. Test output can be recovered (e.g., for
       debugging) by passing --nocapture to the test binaries:

           cargo test -- --nocapture

       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --message-format fmt
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple
           times and consists of comma-separated values. Valid values:

           o  human (default): Display in a human-readable text format.
              Conflicts with short and json.

           o  short: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages. Conflicts with
              human and json.

           o  json: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See the reference
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages>
              for more details. Conflicts with human and short.

           o  json-diagnostic-short: Ensure the rendered field of JSON messages
              contains the “short” rendering from rustc. Cannot be used
              with human or short.

           o  json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi: Ensure the rendered field of JSON
              messages contains embedded ANSI color codes for respecting
              rustc’s default color scheme. Cannot be used with human or
              short.

           o  json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc
              diagnostics in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself
              should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo’s
              own JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still
              emitted. Cannot be used with human or short.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

   Miscellaneous Options
       The --jobs argument affects the building of the test executable but does
       not affect how many threads are used when running the tests. The Rust
       test harness includes an option to control the number of threads used:

           cargo test -j 2 -- --test-threads=2

       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number
           of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value.
           If a string default is provided, it sets the value back to defaults.
           Should not be 0.

       --future-incompat-report
           Displays a future-incompat report for any future-incompatible
           warnings produced during execution of this command

           See cargo-report(1)

       While cargo test involves compilation, it does not provide a
       --keep-going flag. Use --no-fail-fast to run as many tests as possible
       without stopping at the first failure. To “compile” as many tests as
       possible, use --tests to build test binaries separately. For example:

           cargo build --tests --keep-going
           cargo test --tests --no-fail-fast

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Execute all the unit and integration tests of the current package:

              cargo test

       2. Run only tests whose names match against a filter string:

              cargo test name_filter

       3. Run only a specific test within a specific integration test:

              cargo test --test int_test_name -- modname::test_name
