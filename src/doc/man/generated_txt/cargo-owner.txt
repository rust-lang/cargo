CARGO-OWNER(1)

NAME
       cargo-owner — Manage the owners of a crate on the registry

SYNOPSIS
       cargo owner [options] --add login [crate]
       cargo owner [options] --remove login [crate]
       cargo owner [options] --list [crate]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will modify the owners for a crate on the registry. Owners
       of a crate can upload new versions and yank old versions. Non-team
       owners can also modify the set of owners, so take care!

       This command requires you to be authenticated with either the --token
       option or using cargo-login(1).

       If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from
       the current directory.

       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html#cargo-owner>
       for more information about owners and publishing.

OPTIONS
   Owner Options
       -a, --add login…
           Invite the given user or team as an owner.

       -r, --remove login…
           Remove the given user or team as an owner.

       -l, --list
           List owners of a crate.

       --token token
           API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token
           stored in the credentials file (which is created by cargo-login(1)).

           Cargo config <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>
           environment variables can be used to override the tokens stored in
           the credentials file. The token for crates.io may be specified with
           the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. Tokens for other
           registries may be specified with environment variables of the form
           CARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN where NAME is the name of the registry
           in all capital letters.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in Cargo
           config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
           registry.default config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. List owners of a package:

              cargo owner --list foo

       2. Invite an owner to a package:

              cargo owner --add username foo

       3. Remove an owner from a package:

              cargo owner --remove username foo
