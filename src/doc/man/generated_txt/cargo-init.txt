CARGO-INIT(1)

NAME
       cargo-init — Create a new Cargo package in an existing directory

SYNOPSIS
       cargo init [options] [path]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will create a new Cargo manifest in the current directory.
       Give a path as an argument to create in the given directory.

       If there are typically-named Rust source files already in the directory,
       those will be used. If not, then a sample src/main.rs file will be
       created, or src/lib.rs if --lib is passed.

       If the directory is not already in a VCS repository, then a new
       repository is created (see --vcs below).

       See cargo-new(1) for a similar command which will create a new package
       in a new directory.

OPTIONS
   Init Options
       --bin
           Create a package with a binary target (src/main.rs). This is the
           default behavior.

       --lib
           Create a package with a library target (src/lib.rs).

       --edition edition
           Specify the Rust edition to use. Default is 2021. Possible values:
           2015, 2018, 2021, 2024

       --name name
           Set the package name. Defaults to the directory name.

       --vcs vcs
           Initialize a new VCS repository for the given version control system
           (git, hg, pijul, or fossil) or do not initialize any version control
           at all (none). If not specified, defaults to git or the
           configuration value cargo-new.vcs, or none if already inside a VCS
           repository.

       --registry registry
           This sets the publish field in Cargo.toml to the given registry name
           which will restrict publishing only to that registry.

           Registry names are defined in Cargo config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, the default registry defined by the registry.default
           config key is used. If the default registry is not set and
           --registry is not used, the publish field will not be set which
           means that publishing will not be restricted.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Create a binary Cargo package in the current directory:

              cargo init
