CARGO-PUBLISH(1)

NAME
       cargo-publish — Upload a package to the registry

SYNOPSIS
       cargo publish [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This command will create a distributable, compressed .crate file with
       the source code of the package in the current directory and upload it to
       a registry. The default registry is <https://crates.io>. This performs
       the following steps:

       1. Performs a few checks, including:
          o  Checks the package.publish key in the manifest for restrictions on
             which registries you are allowed to publish to.

       2. Create a .crate file by following the steps in cargo-package(1).

       3. Upload the crate to the registry. The server will perform additional
          checks on the crate.

       4. The client will poll waiting for the package to appear in the index,
          and may timeout. In that case, you will need to check for completion
          manually. This timeout does not affect the upload.

       This command requires you to be authenticated with either the --token
       option or using cargo-login(1).

       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html> for more
       details about packaging and publishing.

OPTIONS
   Publish Options
       --dry-run
           Perform all checks without uploading.

       --token token
           API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token
           stored in the credentials file (which is created by cargo-login(1)).

           Cargo config <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>
           environment variables can be used to override the tokens stored in
           the credentials file. The token for crates.io may be specified with
           the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN environment variable. Tokens for other
           registries may be specified with environment variables of the form
           CARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN where NAME is the name of the registry
           in all capital letters.

       --no-verify
           Don’t verify the contents by building them.

       --allow-dirty
           Allow working directories with uncommitted VCS changes to be
           packaged.

       --index index
           The URL of the registry index to use.

       --registry registry
           Name of the registry to publish to. Registry names are defined in
           Cargo config files
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. If not
           specified, and there is a package.publish
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-publish-field>
           field in Cargo.toml with a single registry, then it will publish to
           that registry. Otherwise it will use the default registry, which is
           defined by the registry.default
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#registrydefault>
           config key which defaults to crates-io.

   Package Selection
       By default, the package in the current working directory is selected.
       The -p flag can be used to choose a different package in a workspace.

       -p spec, --package spec
           The package to publish. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC format.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Publish for the given architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>. Run rustc --print target-list for
           a list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple
           times.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number
           of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value.
           If a string default is provided, it sets the value back to defaults.
           Should not be 0.

       --keep-going
           Build as many crates in the dependency graph as possible, rather
           than aborting the build on the first one that fails to build.

           For example if the current package depends on dependencies fails and
           works, one of which fails to build, cargo publish -j1 may or may not
           build the one that succeeds (depending on which one of the two
           builds Cargo picked to run first), whereas cargo publish -j1
           --keep-going would definitely run both builds, even if the one run
           first fails.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Publish the current package:

              cargo publish
