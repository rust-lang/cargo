CARGO-RUN(1)

NAME
       cargo-run — Run the current package

SYNOPSIS
       cargo run [options] [-- args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run a binary or example of the local package.

       All the arguments following the two dashes (--) are passed to the binary
       to run. If you’re passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the
       ones after -- go to the binary, the ones before go to Cargo.

       Unlike cargo-test(1) and cargo-bench(1), cargo run sets the working
       directory of the binary executed to the current working directory, same
       as if it was executed in the shell directly.

OPTIONS
   Package Selection
       By default, the package in the current working directory is selected.
       The -p flag can be used to choose a different package in a workspace.

       -p spec, --package spec
           The package to run. See cargo-pkgid(1) for the SPEC format.

   Target Selection
       When no target selection options are given, cargo run will run the
       binary target. If there are multiple binary targets, you must pass a
       target flag to choose one. Or, the default-run field may be specified in
       the [package] section of Cargo.toml to choose the name of the binary to
       run by default.

       --bin name
           Run the specified binary.

       --example name
           Run the specified example.

   Feature Selection
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When
       no feature options are given, the default feature is activated for every
       selected package.

       See the features documentation
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options>
       for more details.

       -F features, --features features
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of
           workspace members may be enabled with package-name/feature-name
           syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       --all-features
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       --no-default-features
           Do not activate the default feature of the selected packages.

   Compilation Options
       --target triple
           Run for the specified target architecture. The default is the host
           architecture. The general format of the triple is
           <arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>.

           Possible values:

           o  Any supported target in rustc --print target-list.

           o  "host-tuple", which will internally be substituted by the
              host’s target. This can be particularly useful if you’re
              cross-compiling some crates, and don’t want to specify your
              host’s machine as a target (for instance, an xtask in a shared
              project that may be worked on by many hosts).

           o  A path to a custom target specification. See Custom Target Lookup
              Path
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/custom.html#custom-target-lookup-path>
              for more information.

           This may also be specified with the build.target config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode
           where the target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See
           the build cache
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-cache.html>
           documentation for more details.

       -r, --release
           Run optimized artifacts with the release profile. See also the
           --profile option for choosing a specific profile by name.

       --profile name
           Run with the given profile. See the reference
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html> for more
           details on profiles.

       --timings=fmts
           Output information how long each compilation takes, and track
           concurrency information over time. Accepts an optional
           comma-separated list of output formats; --timings without an
           argument will default to --timings=html. Specifying an output format
           (rather than the default) is unstable and requires
           -Zunstable-options. Valid output formats:

           o  html (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Write a
              human-readable file cargo-timing.html to the target/cargo-timings
              directory with a report of the compilation. Also write a report
              to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename if you
              want to look at older runs. HTML output is suitable for human
              consumption only, and does not provide machine-readable timing
              data.

           o  json (unstable, requires -Zunstable-options): Emit
              machine-readable JSON information about timing information.

   Output Options
       --target-dir directory
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May
           also be specified with the CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable, or
           the build.target-dir config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           target in the root of the workspace.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --message-format fmt
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple
           times and consists of comma-separated values. Valid values:

           o  human (default): Display in a human-readable text format.
              Conflicts with short and json.

           o  short: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages. Conflicts with
              human and json.

           o  json: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See the reference
              <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages>
              for more details. Conflicts with human and short.

           o  json-diagnostic-short: Ensure the rendered field of JSON messages
              contains the “short” rendering from rustc. Cannot be used
              with human or short.

           o  json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi: Ensure the rendered field of JSON
              messages contains embedded ANSI color codes for respecting
              rustc’s default color scheme. Cannot be used with human or
              short.

           o  json-render-diagnostics: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc
              diagnostics in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself
              should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo’s
              own JSON diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still
              emitted. Cannot be used with human or short.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --ignore-rust-version
           Ignore rust-version specification in packages.

       --locked
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as
           when the existing Cargo.lock file was originally generated. Cargo
           will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           o  The lock file is missing.

           o  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different
              dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are
           desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --frozen
           Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline.

       --lockfile-path PATH
           Changes the path of the lockfile from the default
           (<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock) to PATH. PATH must end with Cargo.lock
           (e.g. --lockfile-path /tmp/temporary-lockfile/Cargo.lock). Note that
           providing --lockfile-path will ignore existing lockfile at the
           default path, and instead will either use the lockfile from PATH, or
           write a new lockfile into the provided PATH if it doesn’t exist.
           This flag can be used to run most commands in read-only directories,
           writing lockfile into the provided PATH.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #14421
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14421>).

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

   Miscellaneous Options
       -j N, --jobs N
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
           build.jobs config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>. Defaults to
           the number of logical CPUs. If negative, it sets the maximum number
           of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided value.
           If a string default is provided, it sets the value back to defaults.
           Should not be 0.

       --keep-going
           Build as many crates in the dependency graph as possible, rather
           than aborting the build on the first one that fails to build.

           For example if the current package depends on dependencies fails and
           works, one of which fails to build, cargo run -j1 may or may not
           build the one that succeeds (depending on which one of the two
           builds Cargo picked to run first), whereas cargo run -j1
           --keep-going would definitely run both builds, even if the one run
           first fails.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Build the local package and run its main target (assuming only one
          binary):

              cargo run

       2. Run an example with extra arguments:

              cargo run --example exname -- --exoption exarg1 exarg2
