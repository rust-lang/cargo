CARGO-PKGID(1)

NAME
       cargo-pkgid — Print a fully qualified package specification

SYNOPSIS
       cargo pkgid [options] [spec]

DESCRIPTION
       Given a spec argument, print out the fully qualified package ID
       specifier for a package or dependency in the current workspace. This
       command will generate an error if spec is ambiguous as to which package
       it refers to in the dependency graph. If no spec is given, then the
       specifier for the local package is printed.

       This command requires that a lockfile is available and dependencies have
       been fetched.

       A package specifier consists of a name, version, and source URL. You are
       allowed to use partial specifiers to succinctly match a specific package
       as long as it matches only one package. The format of a spec can be one
       of the following:

       | SPEC Structure  | Example SPEC                                     |

OPTIONS
   Package Selection
       -p spec, --package spec
           Get the package ID for the given package instead of the current
           package.

   Display Options
       -v, --verbose
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose”
           output which includes extra output such as dependency warnings and
           build script output. May also be specified with the term.verbose
           config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the
           term.quiet config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

       --color when
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           o  auto (default): Automatically detect if color support is
              available on the terminal.

           o  always: Always display colors.

           o  never: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the term.color config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Manifest Options
       --manifest-path path
           Path to the Cargo.toml file. By default, Cargo searches for the
           Cargo.toml file in the current directory or any parent directory.

       --frozen, --locked
           Either of these flags requires that the Cargo.lock file is
           up-to-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated,
           Cargo will exit with an error. The --frozen flag also prevents Cargo
           from attempting to access the network to determine if it is
           out-of-date.

           These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
           Cargo.lock file is up-to-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid
           network access.

       --offline
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without
           this flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the
           network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than
           online mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are
           downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as
           indicated in the local copy of the index. See the cargo-fetch(1)
           command to download dependencies before going offline.

           May also be specified with the net.offline config value
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>.

   Common Options
       +toolchain
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to
           cargo begins with +, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain
           name (such as +stable or +nightly). See the rustup documentation
           <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html> for more
           information about how toolchain overrides work.

       --config KEY=VALUE or PATH
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in
           TOML syntax of KEY=VALUE, or provided as a path to an extra
           configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See
           the command-line overrides section
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides>
           for more information.

       -C PATH
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified
           operations. This affects things like where cargo looks by default
           for the project manifest (Cargo.toml), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering .cargo/config.toml, for example. This
           option must appear before the command name, for example cargo -C
           path/to/my-project build.

           This option is only available on the nightly channel
           <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html> and
           requires the -Z unstable-options flag to enable (see #10098
           <https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).

       -h, --help
           Prints help information.

       -Z flag
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run cargo -Z help for
           details.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the reference
       <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html>
       for details on environment variables that Cargo reads.

EXIT STATUS
       o  0: Cargo succeeded.

       o  101: Cargo failed to complete.

EXAMPLES
       1. Retrieve package specification for foo package:

              cargo pkgid foo

       2. Retrieve package specification for version 1.0.0 of foo:

              cargo pkgid foo@1.0.0

       3. Retrieve package specification for foo from crates.io:

              cargo pkgid https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index#foo

       4. Retrieve package specification for foo from a local package:

              cargo pkgid file:///path/to/local/package#foo
