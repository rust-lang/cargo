## NAME

cargo-publish --- Upload a package to the registry

## SYNOPSIS

`cargo publish` [_options_]

## DESCRIPTION

This command will create a distributable, compressed `.crate` file with the
source code of the package in the current directory and upload it to a
registry. The default registry is <https://crates.io>. This performs the
following steps:

1. Performs a few checks, including:
   - Checks the `package.publish` key in the manifest for restrictions on
     which registries you are allowed to publish to.
2. Create a `.crate` file by following the steps in {{man "cargo-package" 1}}.
3. Upload the crate to the registry. The server will perform additional
   checks on the crate. 
4. The client will poll waiting for the package to appear in the index,
   and may timeout. In that case, you will need to check for completion
   manually. This timeout does not affect the upload.

This command requires you to be authenticated with either the `--token` option
or using {{man "cargo-login" 1}}.
Alternatively, you can set `--token-stdin` flag and pipe the _token_ value to stdin.

See [the reference](../reference/publishing.html) for more details about
packaging and publishing.

{{#option "`--registry` _registry_"}}
Name of the registry to publish to. Registry names are defined in [Cargo

[`package.publish`](../reference/manifest.html#the-publish-field) field in
`Cargo.toml` with a single registry, then it will publish to that registry.
Otherwise it will use the default registry, which is defined by the
[`registry.default`](../reference/config.html#registrydefault) config key
which defaults to `crates-io`.
