# Web API

A registry may host a web API at the location defined in `config.json` to
support any of the actions listed below.

Cargo includes the `Authorization` header for requests that require
authentication. The header value is the API token. The server should respond
with a 403 response code if the token is not valid. Users are expected to
visit the registry's website to obtain a token, and Cargo can store the token
using the [`cargo login`] command, or by passing the token on the
command-line.

Responses use a 2xx response code for success.
Errors should use an appropriate response code, such as 404.
Failure
responses should have a JSON object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    // Array of errors to display to the user.
    "errors": [
        {
            // The error message as a string.
            "detail": "error message text"
        }
    ]
}
```

If the response has this structure Cargo will display the detailed message to the user, even if the response code is 200.
If the response code indicates an error and the content does not have this structure, Cargo will display to the user a
 message intended to help debugging the server error. A server returning an `errors` object allows a registry to provide a more
detailed or user-centric error message.

For backwards compatibility, servers should ignore any unexpected query
parameters or JSON fields. If a JSON field is missing, it should be assumed to
be null. The endpoints are versioned with the `v1` component of the path, and
Cargo is responsible for handling backwards compatibility fallbacks should any
be required in the future.

Cargo sets the following headers for all requests:

- `Content-Type`: `application/json` (for requests with a body payload)
- `Accept`: `application/json`
- `User-Agent`: The Cargo version such as `cargo/1.32.0 (8610973aa
  2019-01-02)`. This may be modified by the user in a configuration value.
  Added in 1.29.

## Publish

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/new`
- Method: PUT
- Authorization: Included

The publish endpoint is used to publish a new version of a crate. The server
should validate the crate, make it available for download, and add it to the
index.

It is not required for the index to be updated before the successful response is sent.
After a successful response, Cargo will poll the index for a short period of time to identify that the new crate has been added.
If the crate does not appear in the index after a short period of time, then Cargo will display a warning letting the user know that the new crate is not yet available.

The body of the data sent by Cargo is:

- 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer of the length of JSON data.
- Metadata of the package as a JSON object.
- 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer of the length of the `.crate` file.
- The `.crate` file.

The following is a commented example of the JSON object. Some notes of some
restrictions imposed by [crates.io] are included only to illustrate some
suggestions on types of validation that may be done, and should not be
considered as an exhaustive list of restrictions [crates.io] imposes.

```javascript

    // The name of the package.
    "name": "foo",
    // The version of the package being published.

            // If the dependency is renamed from the original package name,
            // this is the original name. The new package name is stored in
            // the `explicit_name_in_toml` field.

            // "dev", "build", or "normal".
            "kind": "normal",
            // The URL of the index of the registry where this dependency is
            // from as a string. If not specified or null, it is assumed the
            // dependency is in the current registry.
            "registry": null,
            // If the dependency is renamed, this is a string of the new

    ],
    // Set of features defined for the package.

    // May be null.
    "license_file": null,

    // May be null.
    "repository": null,
    // Optional object of "status" badges. Each value is an object of
    // arbitrary string to string mappings.
    // crates.io has special interpretation of the format of the badges.
    "badges": {

            "repository": "rust-lang/cargo"
        }

```

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Optional object of warnings to display to the user.
    "warnings": {
        // Array of strings of categories that are invalid and ignored.
        "invalid_categories": [],
        // Array of strings of badge names that are invalid and ignored.
        "invalid_badges": [],
        // Array of strings of arbitrary warnings to display to the user.
        "other": []
    }
}
```

## Yank

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/{version}/yank`
- Method: DELETE
- Authorization: Included

The yank endpoint will set the `yank` field of the given version of a crate to
`true` in the index.

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Indicates the yank succeeded, always true.
    "ok": true,
}
```

## Unyank

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/{version}/unyank`
- Method: PUT
- Authorization: Included

The unyank endpoint will set the `yank` field of the given version of a crate
to `false` in the index.

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Indicates the unyank succeeded, always true.
    "ok": true,
}
```

## Owners

Cargo does not have an inherent notion of users and owners, but it does
provide the `owner` command to assist managing who has authorization to
control a crate. It is up to the registry to decide exactly how users and
owners are handled. See the [publishing documentation] for a description of
how [crates.io] handles owners via GitHub users and teams.

### Owners: List

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
- Method: GET
- Authorization: Included

The owners endpoint returns a list of owners of the crate.

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Array of owners of the crate.
    "users": [
        {
            // Unique unsigned 32-bit integer of the owner.
            "id": 70,
            // The unique username of the owner.
            "login": "github:rust-lang:core",
            // Name of the owner.
            // This is optional and may be null.
            "name": "Core",
        }
    ]
}
```

### Owners: Add

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
- Method: PUT
- Authorization: Included

A PUT request will send a request to the registry to add a new owner to a
crate. It is up to the registry how to handle the request. For example,
[crates.io] sends an invite to the user that they must accept before being
added.

The request should include the following JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Array of `login` strings of owners to add.
    "users": ["login_name"]
}
```

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Indicates the add succeeded, always true.
    "ok": true,
    // A string to be displayed to the user.
    "msg": "user ehuss has been invited to be an owner of crate cargo"
}
```

### Owners: Remove

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}/owners`
- Method: DELETE
- Authorization: Included

A DELETE request will remove an owner from a crate. The request should include
the following JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Array of `login` strings of owners to remove.
    "users": ["login_name"]
}
```

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Indicates the remove succeeded, always true.
    "ok": true
    // A string to be displayed to the user. Currently ignored by cargo.
    "msg": "owners successfully removed",
}
```

## Search

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/crates`
- Method: GET
- Query Parameters:
    - `q`: The search query string.
    - `per_page`: Number of results, default 10, max 100.

The search request will perform a search for crates, using criteria defined on
the server.

A successful response includes the JSON object:

```javascript
{
    // Array of results.
    "crates": [
        {
            // Name of the crate.
            "name": "rand",
            // The highest version available.
            "max_version": "0.6.1",
            // Textual description of the crate.
            "description": "Random number generators and other randomness functionality.\n",
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        // Total number of results available on the server.
        "total": 119
    }
}
```

## Login

- Endpoint: `/me`

The "login" endpoint is not an actual API request. It exists solely for the
[`cargo login`] command to display a URL to instruct a user to visit in a web
browser to log in and retrieve an API token.
