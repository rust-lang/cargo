# Publishing on crates.io

Once you've got a library that you'd like to share with the world, it's time to
publish it on [crates.io]! Publishing a crate is when a specific
version is uploaded to be hosted on [crates.io].

Take care when publishing a crate, because a publish is **permanent**. The
version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. There is no
limit to the number of versions which can be published, however.

## Before your first publish

First things first, you’ll need an account on [crates.io] to acquire
an API token. To do so, [visit the home page][crates.io] and log in via a GitHub
account (required for now). You will also need to provide and verify your email
address on the [Account Settings](https://crates.io/settings/profile) page. Once
that is done [create an API token](https://crates.io/settings/tokens), make sure
you copy it. Once you leave the page you will not be able to see it again.

Then run the [`cargo login`] command.

```console
$ cargo login
```

Then at the prompt put in the token specified.
```console
please paste the API Token found on https://crates.io/me below
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
```

This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in your
`~/.cargo/credentials.toml`. Note that this token is a **secret** and should not be
shared with anyone else. If it leaks for any reason, you should revoke it
immediately.

> **Note**: The [`cargo logout`] command can be used to remove the token from
> `credentials.toml`. This can be useful if you no longer need it stored on
> the local machine.

## Before publishing a new crate

Keep in mind that crate names on [crates.io] are allocated on a first-come-first-serve
basis. Once a crate name is taken, it cannot be used for another crate.

Check out the [metadata you can specify](manifest.md) in `Cargo.toml` to
ensure your crate can be discovered more easily! Before publishing, make sure
you have filled out the following fields:

- [`license` or `license-file`]
- [`description`]
- [`homepage`]
- [`repository`]
- [`readme`]

It would also be a good idea to include some [`keywords`] and [`categories`],
though they are not required.

If you are publishing a library, you may also want to consult the [Rust API
Guidelines].

### Packaging a crate

The next step is to package up your crate and upload it to [crates.io]. For
this we’ll use the [`cargo publish`] subcommand. This command performs the following
steps:

1. Perform some verification checks on your package.
2. Compress your source code into a `.crate` file.
3. Extract the `.crate` file into a temporary directory and verify that it
   compiles.
4. Upload the `.crate` file to [crates.io].
5. The registry will perform some additional checks on the uploaded package
   before adding it.

It is recommended that you first run `cargo publish --dry-run` (or [`cargo
package`] which is equivalent) to ensure there aren't any warnings or errors
before publishing. This will perform the first three steps listed above.

```console
$ cargo publish --dry-run
```

You can inspect the generated `.crate` file in the `target/package` directory.
[crates.io] currently has a 10MB size limit on the `.crate` file. You may want
to check the size of the `.crate` file to ensure you didn't accidentally
package up large assets that are not required to build your package, such as
test data, website documentation, or code generation. You can check which
files are included with the following command:

```console
$ cargo package --list
```

Cargo will automatically ignore files ignored by your version control system
when packaging, but if you want to specify an extra set of files to ignore you
can use the [`exclude` key](manifest.md#the-exclude-and-include-fields) in the
manifest:

```toml
[package]
# ...
exclude = [
    "public/assets/*",
    "videos/*",
]
```

If you’d rather explicitly list the files to include, Cargo also supports an
[`include` key](manifest.md#the-exclude-and-include-fields), which if set, overrides the `exclude` key:

```toml
[package]
# ...
include = [
    "**/*.rs",
]
```

## Uploading the crate

When you are ready to publish, use the [`cargo publish`] command
to upload to [crates.io]:

```console
$ cargo publish
```

And that’s it, you’ve now published your first crate!

## Publishing a new version of an existing crate

In order to release a new version, change [the `version` value](manifest.md#the-version-field) specified in your `Cargo.toml` manifest.
Keep in mind [the SemVer rules](semver.md) which provide guidelines on what is a compatible change.
Then run [`cargo publish`] as described above to upload the new version.

> **Recommendation:** Consider the full release process and automate what you can.
>
> Each version should include:
> - A changelog entry, preferably [manually curated](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) though a generated one is better than nothing
> - A [git tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) pointing to the published commit
>
> Examples of third-party tools that are representative of different workflows include (in alphabetical order):
> - [cargo-release](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release)
> - [cargo-smart-release](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-smart-release)
> - [release-plz](https://crates.io/crates/release-plz)
>
> For more, see [crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=cargo%20release).

## Managing a crates.io-based crate

Management of crates is primarily done through the command line `cargo` tool
rather than the [crates.io] web interface. For this, there are a few subcommands
to manage a crate.

### `cargo yank`

Occasions may arise where you publish a version of a crate that actually ends up
being broken for one reason or another (syntax error, forgot to include a file,
etc.). For situations such as this, Cargo supports a “yank” of a version of a
crate.

```console
$ cargo yank --version 1.0.1
$ cargo yank --version 1.0.1 --undo
```

A yank **does not** delete any code. This feature is not intended for deleting
accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must reset
those secrets immediately.

The semantics of a yanked version are that no new dependencies can be created
against that version, but all existing dependencies continue to work. One of the
major goals of [crates.io] is to act as a permanent archive of crates that does
not change over time, and allowing deletion of a version would go against this
goal. Essentially a yank means that all packages with a `Cargo.lock` will not
break, while any future `Cargo.lock` files generated will not list the yanked
version.

### `cargo owner`

A crate is often developed by more than one person, or the primary maintainer
may change over time! The owner of a crate is the only person allowed to publish
new versions of the crate, but an owner may designate additional owners.

```console
$ cargo owner --add github-handle
$ cargo owner --remove github-handle
$ cargo owner --add github:rust-lang:owners
$ cargo owner --remove github:rust-lang:owners
```

The owner IDs given to these commands must be GitHub user names or GitHub teams.

If a user name is given to `--add`, that user is invited as a “named” owner, with
full rights to the crate. In addition to being able to publish or yank versions
of the crate, they have the ability to add or remove owners, *including* the
owner that made *them* an owner. Needless to say, you shouldn’t make people you
don’t fully trust into a named owner. In order to become a named owner, a user
must have logged into [crates.io] previously.

If a team name is given to `--add`, that team is invited as a “team” owner, with
restricted right to the crate. While they have permission to publish or yank
versions of the crate, they *do not* have the ability to add or remove owners.
In addition to being more convenient for managing groups of owners, teams are
just a bit more secure against owners becoming malicious.

The syntax for teams is currently `github:org:team` (see examples above).
In order to invite a team as an owner one must be a member of that team. No
such restriction applies to removing a team as an owner.

## GitHub permissions

Team membership is not something GitHub provides simple public access to, and it
is likely for you to encounter the following message when working with them:

> It looks like you don’t have permission to query a necessary property from
GitHub to complete this request. You may need to re-authenticate on [crates.io]
to grant permission to read GitHub org memberships.

This is basically a catch-all for “you tried to query a team, and one of the
five levels of membership access control denied this”. That is not an
exaggeration. GitHub’s support for team access control is Enterprise Grade.

The most likely cause of this is simply that you last logged in before this
feature was added. We originally requested *no* permissions from GitHub when
authenticating users, because we didn’t actually ever use the user’s token for
anything other than logging them in. However to query team membership on your
behalf, we now require [the `read:org` scope][oauth-scopes].

You are free to deny us this scope, and everything that worked before teams
were introduced will keep working. However you will never be able to add a team
as an owner, or publish a crate as a team owner. If you ever attempt to do this,
you will get the error above. You may also see this error if you ever try to
publish a crate that you don’t own at all, but otherwise happens to have a team.

If you ever change your mind, or just aren’t sure if [crates.io] has sufficient
permission, you can always go to <https://crates.io/> and re-authenticate,
which will prompt you for permission if [crates.io] doesn’t have all the scopes
it would like to.

An additional barrier to querying GitHub is that the organization may be
actively denying third party access. To check this, you can go to:

```text
https://github.com/organizations/:org/settings/oauth_application_policy
```

where `:org` is the name of the organization (e.g., `rust-lang`). You may see
something like:

![Organization Access Control](../images/org-level-acl.png)

Where you may choose to explicitly remove [crates.io] from your organization’s
blacklist, or simply press the “Remove Restrictions” button to allow all third
party applications to access this data.

Alternatively, when [crates.io] requested the `read:org` scope, you could have
explicitly whitelisted [crates.io] querying the org in question by pressing
the “Grant Access” button next to its name:

![Authentication Access Control](../images/auth-level-acl.png)

### Troubleshooting GitHub team access errors

When trying to add a GitHub team as crate owner, you may see an error like:

```text
error: failed to invite owners to crate <crate_name>: api errors (status 200 OK): could not find the github team org/repo
```
In that case, you should go to [the GitHub Application settings page] and
check if crates.io is listed in the `Authorized OAuth Apps` tab.
If it isn't, you should go to <https://crates.io/> and authorize it.
Then go back to the Application Settings page on GitHub, click on the
crates.io application in the list, and make sure you or your organization is
listed in the "Organization access" list with a green check mark. If there's
a button labeled `Grant` or `Request`, you should grant the access or
request the org owner to do so.
