//! Management of the directory layout of a build
//!
//! The directory layout is a little tricky at times, hence a separate file to
//! house this logic. The current layout looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! # This is the root directory for all output, the top-level package
//! # places all of its output here.
//! target/
//!
//!     # Cache of `rustc -Vv` output for performance.
//!     .rustc-info.json
//!
//!     # All final artifacts are linked into this directory from `deps`.
//!     # Note that named profiles will soon be included as separate directories
//!     # here. They have a restricted format, similar to Rust identifiers, so
//!     # Cargo-specific directories added in the future should use some prefix
//!     # like `.` to avoid name collisions.
//!     debug/  # or release/
//!
//!         # File used to lock the directory to prevent multiple cargo processes
//!         # from using it at the same time.
//!         .cargo-lock
//!
//!         # Hidden directory that holds all of the fingerprint files for all
//!         # packages
//!         .fingerprint/
//!             # Each package is in a separate directory.
//!             # Note that different target kinds have different filename prefixes.
//!             $pkgname-$META/
//!                 # Set of source filenames for this package.
//!                 dep-lib-$targetname
//!                 # Timestamp when this package was last built.
//!                 invoked.timestamp
//!                 # The fingerprint hash.
//!                 lib-$targetname
//!                 # Detailed information used for logging the reason why
//!                 # something is being recompiled.
//!                 lib-$targetname.json
//!                 # The console output from the compiler. This is cached
//!                 # so that warnings can be redisplayed for "fresh" units.
//!                 output-lib-$targetname
//!
//!         # This is the root directory for all rustc artifacts except build
//!         # scripts, examples, and test and bench executables. Almost every
//!         # artifact should have a metadata hash added to its filename to
//!         # prevent collisions. One notable exception is dynamic libraries.
//!         deps/
//!
//!             # Each artifact dependency gets in its own directory.
//!             /artifact/$pkgname-$META/$kind
//!
//!         # Root directory for all compiled examples.
//!         examples/
//!
//!         # Directory used to store incremental data for the compiler (when
//!         # incremental is enabled.
//!         incremental/
//!
//!         # This is the location at which the output of all custom build
//!         # commands are rooted.
//!         build/
//!
//!             # Each package gets its own directory where its build script and
//!             # script output are placed
//!             $pkgname-$META/    # For the build script itself.
//!                 # The build script executable (name may be changed by user).
