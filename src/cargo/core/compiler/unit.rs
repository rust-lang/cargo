/// A unit is an object that has enough information so that cargo knows how to build it.
/// For example, if your package has dependencies, then every dependency will be built as a library
/// unit. If your package is a library, then it will be built as a library unit as well, or if it
/// is a binary with `main.rs`, then a binary will be output. There are also separate unit types
/// for `test`ing and `check`ing, amongst others.
///
/// The unit also holds information about all possible metadata about the package in `pkg`.
///
/// A unit needs to know extra information in addition to the type and root source file. For
/// example, it needs to know the target architecture (OS, chip arch etc.) and it needs to know
/// whether you want a debug or release build. There is enough information in this struct to figure
