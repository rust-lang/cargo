//! Job management (mostly for windows)
//!
//! Most of the time when you're running cargo you expect Ctrl-C to actually
//! terminate the entire tree of processes in play, not just the one at the top
//! (cargo). This currently works "by default" on Unix platforms because Ctrl-C
//! actually sends a signal to the *process group* rather than the parent
//! process, so everything will get torn down. On Windows, however, this does
//! not happen and Ctrl-C just kills cargo.
//!
//! To achieve the same semantics on Windows we use Job Objects to ensure that
//! all processes die at the same time. Job objects have a mode of operation
//! where when all handles to the object are closed it causes all child
//! processes associated with the object to be terminated immediately.
//! Conveniently whenever a process in the job object spawns a new process the
//! child will be associated with the job object as well. This means if we add
//! ourselves to the job object we create then everything will get torn down!
