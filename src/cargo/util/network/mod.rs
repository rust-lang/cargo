/// Currently Cargo requests the `http2` feature of the `curl` crate which
/// means it should always be built in. On OSX, however, we ship cargo still
/// linked against the system libcurl. Building curl with ALPN support for
/// HTTP/2 requires newer versions of OSX (the SecureTransport API) than we
/// want to ship Cargo for. By linking Cargo against the system libcurl then
/// older curl installations won't use HTTP/2 but newer ones will. All that to
/// basically say we ignore errors here on OSX, but consider this a fatal error
/// to not activate HTTP/2 on all other platforms.
///
/// `pipewait` is an option which indicates that if there's a bunch of parallel
/// requests to the same host they all wait until the pipelining status of the
/// host is known. This means that we won't initiate dozens of connections but
/// rather only one. Once the main one is opened we realized that pipelining is
/// possible and multiplexing is possible. All in all this reduces the number
/// of connections down to a more manageable state.
