//! # Cargo as a library
//!
//! There are two places you can find API documentation of cargo-the-library,
//!
//! - <https://docs.rs/cargo>: targeted at external tool developers using cargo-the-library
//!   - Released with every rustc release
//! - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo>: targeted at cargo contributors
//!   - Updated on each update of the `cargo` submodule in `rust-lang/rust`
//!
//! > This library is maintained by the Cargo team, primarily for use by Cargo
//! > and not intended for external use (except as a transitive dependency). This
//! > crate may make major changes to its APIs. See [The Cargo Book:
//! > External tools] for more on this topic.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Major components of cargo include:
//!
//! - [`ops`]:
//!   Every major operation is implemented here. Each command is a thin wrapper around ops.
//!   - [`ops::cargo_compile`]:
//!     This is the entry point for all the compilation commands. This is a
//!     good place to start if you want to follow how compilation starts and
//!     flows to completion.
//! - [`ops::resolve`]:
//!   Top-level API for dependency and feature resolver (e.g. [`ops::resolve_ws`])
//!   - [`core::resolver`]: The core algorithm
//! - [`core::compiler`]:
//!   This is the code responsible for running `rustc` and `rustdoc`.
//!   - [`core::compiler::build_context`]:
//!     The [`BuildContext`][core::compiler::BuildContext] is the result of the "front end" of the
//!     build process. This contains the graph of work to perform and any settings necessary for
//!     `rustc`. After this is built, the next stage of building is handled in
//!     [`BuildRunner`][core::compiler::BuildRunner].
//!   - [`core::compiler::build_runner`]:
//!     The `Context` is the mutable state used during the build process. This
//!     is the core of the build process, and everything is coordinated through
//!     this.
//!   - [`core::compiler::fingerprint`]:
//!     The `fingerprint` module contains all the code that handles detecting
//!     if a crate needs to be recompiled.
//! - [`sources::source`]:
//!   The [`sources::source::Source`] trait is an abstraction over different sources of packages.
//!   Sources are uniquely identified by a [`core::SourceId`]. Sources are implemented in the [`sources`]
//!   directory.
//! - [`util`]:
//!   This directory contains generally-useful utility modules.
//! - [`util::context`]:
//!   This directory contains the global application context.
//!   This includes the config parser which makes heavy use of
//!   [serde](https://serde.rs/) to merge and translate config values.
//!   The [`util::GlobalContext`] is usually accessed from the
//!   [`core::Workspace`]
//!   though references to it are scattered around for more convenient access.
//! - [`util::toml`]:
//!   This directory contains the code for parsing `Cargo.toml` files.
//!   - [`ops::lockfile`]:
//!     This is where `Cargo.lock` files are loaded and saved.
//!
//! Related crates:
//! - [`cargo-platform`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-platform)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_platform)):
//!   This library handles parsing `cfg` expressions.
//! - [`cargo-util`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-util)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_util)):
//!   This contains general utility code that is shared between cargo and the testsuite
//! - [`cargo-util-schemas`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-util-schemas)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_util_schemas)):
//!   This contains the serde schemas for cargo
//! - [`crates-io`](https://crates.io/crates/crates-io)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/crates_io)):
//!   This contains code for accessing the crates.io API.
//! - [`home`](https://crates.io/crates/home):
//!   This library is shared between cargo and rustup and is used for finding their home directories.
//!   This is not directly depended upon with a `path` dependency; cargo uses the version from crates.io.
//!   It is intended to be versioned and published independently of Rust's release system.
//!   Whenever a change needs to be made, bump the version in Cargo.toml and `cargo publish` it manually, and then update cargo's `Cargo.toml` to depend on the new version.
//! - [`rustfix`](https://crates.io/crates/rustfix)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustfix)):
//!   This defines structures that represent fix suggestions from rustc,
//!   as well as generates "fixed" code from suggestions.
//!   Operations in `rustfix` are all in memory and won't write to disks.
//! - [`cargo-test-support`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/cargo-test-support)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_test_support/index.html)):
//!   This contains a variety of code to support writing tests
//! - [`cargo-test-macro`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/cargo-test-macro)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo_test_macro/index.html)):
//!   This is the `#[cargo_test]` proc-macro used by the test suite to define tests.
//! - [`credential`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/credential)
//!   This subdirectory contains several packages for implementing the
//!   [credential providers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registry-authentication.html).
//! - [`mdman`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/mdman)
//!   ([nightly docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/mdman/index.html)):
//!   This is a utility for generating cargo's man pages. See [Building the man
//!   pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc#building-the-man-pages)
//!   for more information.
//! - [`resolver-tests`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/crates/resolver-tests)
//!   This is a dedicated package that defines tests for the [dependency
//!   resolver][core::resolver].
//!
//! ### File Overview
//!
//! Files that interact with cargo include
//!
//! - Package
//!   - `Cargo.toml`: User-written project manifest, loaded with [`util::toml::read_manifest`] and then
//!     translated to [`core::manifest::Manifest`] which maybe stored in a [`core::Package`].
//!     - This is editable with [`util::toml_mut::manifest::LocalManifest`]
//!   - `Cargo.lock`: Generally loaded with [`ops::resolve_ws`] or a variant of it into a [`core::resolver::Resolve`]
//!     - At the lowest level, [`ops::load_pkg_lockfile`] and [`ops::write_pkg_lockfile`] are used
//!     - See [`core::resolver::encode`] for versioning of `Cargo.lock`
//!   - `target/`: Used for build artifacts and abstracted with [`core::compiler::layout`]. `Layout` handles locking the target directory and providing paths to parts inside. There is a separate `Layout` for each build `target`.
//!     - `target/debug/.fingerprint`: Tracker whether nor not a crate needs to be rebuilt.  See [`core::compiler::fingerprint`]
//! - `$CARGO_HOME/`:
//!   - `registry/`: Package registry cache which is managed in [`sources::registry`].  Be careful
//!     as the lock [`util::GlobalContext::acquire_package_cache_lock`] must be manually acquired.
//!     - `index`/: Fast-to-access crate metadata (no need to download / extract `*.crate` files)
//!     - `cache/*/*.crate`: Local cache of published crates
//!     - `src/*/*`: Extracted from `*.crate` by [`sources::registry::RegistrySource`]
//!   - `git/`: Git source cache.  See [`sources::git`].
//! - `**/.cargo/config.toml`: Environment dependent (env variables, files) configuration.  See
//!   [`util::context`]
//!
//! ## Contribute to Cargo documentations
//!
//! The Cargo team always continues improving all external and internal documentations.
//! If you spot anything could be better, don't hesitate to discuss with the team on
//! Zulip [`t-cargo` stream], or [submit an issue] right on GitHub.
//! There is also an issue label [`A-documenting-cargo-itself`],
//! which is generally for documenting user-facing [The Cargo Book],
//! but the Cargo team is welcome any form of enhancement for the [Cargo Contributor Guide]
//! and this API documentation as well.
