.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo package [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command will create a distributable, compressed \fB.crate\fP file with the
source code of the package in the current directory and upload it to a
registry. The default registry is \c
.URL "https://crates.io" "" "."
This performs the
following steps:
.sp

.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
Performs a few checks, including:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

Checks the \fBpackage.publish\fP key in the manifest for restrictions on which
registries you are allowed to publish to.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\

Create a \fB.crate\fP file by following the steps in \fBcargo\-package\fP(1).

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1

Upload the crate to the registry. Note that the server will perform
additional checks on the crate.

This command requires you to be authenticated with either the \fB\-\-token\fP option
or using \fBcargo\-login\fP(1).

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-token\fP \fITOKEN\fP

the credentials file (which is created by \fBcargo\-login\fP(1)).
.sp
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "Cargo config" " "
environment variables can be
used to override the tokens stored in the credentials file. The token for
crates.io may be specified with the \fBCARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN\fP environment
variable. Tokens for other registries may be specified with environment
variables of the form \fBCARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN\fP where \fBNAME\fP is the name
of the registry in all capital letters.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-verify\fP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-allow\-dirty\fP

\fB\-\-index\fP \fIINDEX\fP
.RS 4
The URL of the registry index to use.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-registry\fP \fIREGISTRY\fP
.RS 4
Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "Cargo config files" "."
If not specified, the default registry is used, which is defined by the
\fBregistry.default\fP config key which defaults to \fBcrates\-io\fP.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Publish for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \fBtarget\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches in the current
directory or any parent directory for the \fBCargo.toml\fP file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.

includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
