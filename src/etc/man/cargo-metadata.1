.SH "NAME"
cargo\-metadata \- Machine\-readable metadata about the current package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo metadata [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Output the resolved dependencies of a package, the concrete used versions
including overrides, in JSON to stdout.
.sp
It is recommended to include the \fB\-\-format\-version\fP flag to future\-proof
your code to ensure the output is in the format you are expecting.
.sp
See the \c
.URL "https://crates.io/crates/cargo_metadata" "cargo_metadata crate"
for a Rust API for reading the metadata.
.SH "OUTPUT FORMAT"
.sp
The output has the following format:
.sp
