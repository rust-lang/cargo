cargo\-update \[em] Update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo update\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIspec\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command will update dependencies in the \fBCargo.lock\fR file to the latest
version. If the \fBCargo.lock\fR file does not exist, it will be created with the
latest available versions.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Update Options"
.sp
\fIspec\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4
Update only the specified packages. This flag may be specified
multiple times. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fR(1) for the SPEC format.
.sp
If packages are specified with \fIspec\fR, then a conservative update of
the lockfile will be performed. This means that only the dependency specified
by SPEC will be updated. Its transitive dependencies will be updated only if
SPEC cannot be updated without updating dependencies.  All other dependencies
will remain locked at their currently recorded versions.
.sp
If \fIspec\fR is not specified, all dependencies are updated.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-recursive\fR
.RS 4
When used with \fIspec\fR, dependencies of \fIspec\fR are forced to update as well.
Cannot be used with \fB\-\-precise\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-precise\fR \fIprecise\fR
.RS 4
When used with \fIspec\fR, allows you to specify a specific version number to set
the package to. If the package comes from a git repository, this can be a git
revision (such as a SHA hash or tag).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-w\fR, 
\fB\-\-workspace\fR
.RS 4
Attempt to update only packages defined in the workspace. Other packages
are updated only if they don\[cq]t already exist in the lockfile. This
option is useful for updating \fBCargo.lock\fR after you\[cq]ve changed version
numbers in \fBCargo.toml\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.RS 4
Displays what would be updated, but doesn\[cq]t actually write the lockfile.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fR, 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for \[lq]very verbose\[rq] output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fR, 
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Do not print cargo log messages.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.quiet\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-color\fR \fIwhen\fR
.RS 4
Control when colored output is used. Valid values:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBauto\fR (default): Automatically detect if color support is available on the
terminal.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBalways\fR: Always display colors.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+02'\fBnever\fR: Never display colors.
.RE
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBterm.color\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fR file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fR file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fR, 
\fB\-\-locked\fR
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fR file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fR flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fR file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fR
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fR(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB+\fR\fItoolchain\fR
.RS 4
If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to \fBcargo\fR
begins with \fB+\fR, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such
as \fB+stable\fR or \fB+nightly\fR).
See the \fIrustup documentation\fR <https://rust\-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html>
for more information about how toolchain overrides work.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-config\fR \fIKEY=VALUE\fR or \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of \fBKEY=VALUE\fR,
or provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times.
See the \fIcommand\-line overrides section\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command\-line\-overrides> for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects
things like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (\fBCargo.toml\fR), as well as
the directories searched for discovering \fB\&.cargo/config.toml\fR, for example. This option must
appear before the command name, for example \fBcargo \-C path/to/my\-project build\fR\&.
.sp
This option is only available on the \fInightly
channel\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html> and
requires the \fB\-Z unstable\-options\fR flag to enable (see
\fI#10098\fR <https://github.com/rust\-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fR, 
\fB\-\-help\fR
