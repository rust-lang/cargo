cargo\-tree \[em] Display a tree visualization of a dependency graph
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo tree\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command will display a tree of dependencies to the terminal. An example
of a simple project that depends on the \[lq]rand\[rq] package:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
`\-\- rand v0.7.3
    |\-\- getrandom v0.1.14
    |   |\-\- cfg\-if v0.1.10
    |   `\-\- libc v0.2.68
    |\-\- libc v0.2.68 (*)
    |\-\- rand_chacha v0.2.2
    |   |\-\- ppv\-lite86 v0.2.6
    |   `\-\- rand_core v0.5.1
    |       `\-\- getrandom v0.1.14 (*)
    `\-\- rand_core v0.5.1 (*)
[build\-dependencies]
`\-\- cc v1.0.50
.fi
.RE
.sp
Packages marked with \fB(*)\fR have been \[lq]de\-duplicated\[rq]\&. The dependencies for the
package have already been shown elsewhere in the graph, and so are not
repeated. Use the \fB\-\-no\-dedupe\fR option to repeat the duplicates.
.sp
The \fB\-e\fR flag can be used to select the dependency kinds to display. The
\[lq]features\[rq] kind changes the output to display the features enabled by
each dependency. For example, \fBcargo tree \-e features\fR:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
myproject v0.1.0 (/myproject)
`\-\- log feature "serde"
    `\-\- log v0.4.8
        |\-\- serde v1.0.106
        `\-\- cfg\-if feature "default"
            `\-\- cfg\-if v0.1.10
.fi
.RE
.sp
In this tree, \fBmyproject\fR depends on \fBlog\fR with the \fBserde\fR feature. \fBlog\fR in
turn depends on \fBcfg\-if\fR with \[lq]default\[rq] features. When using \fB\-e features\fR it
can be helpful to use \fB\-i\fR flag to show how the features flow into a package.
See the examples below for more detail.
.SS "Feature Unification"
This command shows a graph much closer to a feature\-unified graph Cargo will
build, rather than what you list in \fBCargo.toml\fR\&. For instance, if you specify
the same dependency in both \fB[dependencies]\fR and \fB[dev\-dependencies]\fR but with
different features on. This command may merge all features and show a \fB(*)\fR on
one of the dependency to indicate the duplicate.
.sp
As a result, for a mostly equivalent overview of what \fBcargo build\fR does,
\fBcargo tree \-e normal,build\fR is pretty close; for a mostly equivalent overview
of what \fBcargo test\fR does, \fBcargo tree\fR is pretty close. However, it doesn\[cq]t
guarantee the exact equivalence to what Cargo is going to build, since a
compilation is complex and depends on lots of different factors.
.sp

\fIdedicated section\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature\-unification>\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Tree Options"
.sp
\fB\-i\fR \fIspec\fR, 
\fB\-\-invert\fR \fIspec\fR
.RS 4
Show the reverse dependencies for the given package. This flag will invert
the tree and display the packages that depend on the given package.
.sp
Note that in a workspace, by default it will only display the package\[cq]s
reverse dependencies inside the tree of the workspace member in the current
directory. The \fB\-\-workspace\fR flag can be used to extend it so that it will
show the package\[cq]s reverse dependencies across the entire workspace. The \fB\-p\fR
flag can be used to display the package\[cq]s reverse dependencies only with the
subtree of the package given to \fB\-p\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-prune\fR \fIspec\fR
.RS 4
Prune the given package from the display of the dependency tree.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-depth\fR \fIdepth\fR
.RS 4
Maximum display depth of the dependency tree. A depth of 1 displays the direct
dependencies, for example.
.sp
If the given value is \fBworkspace\fR, only shows the dependencies that are member
of the current workspace, instead.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-dedupe\fR
.RS 4
Do not de\-duplicate repeated dependencies. Usually, when a package has already
displayed its dependencies, further occurrences will not re\-display its
dependencies, and will include a \fB(*)\fR to indicate it has already been shown.
This flag will cause those duplicates to be repeated.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fR, 
\fB\-\-duplicates\fR
.RS 4
Show only dependencies which come in multiple versions (implies \fB\-\-invert\fR).
When used with the \fB\-p\fR flag, only shows duplicates within the subtree of the
given package.
.sp
It can be beneficial for build times and executable sizes to avoid building
that same package multiple times. This flag can help identify the offending
packages. You can then investigate if the package that depends on the
duplicate with the older version can be updated to the newer version so that
only one instance is built.

.SS "Package Selection"
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fR key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fR), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026], 
\fB\-\-package\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4
Display only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fR(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix
glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell accidentally
expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes or
double quotes around each pattern.
.RE

\fB\-\-workspace\fR
.RS 4
Display all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fISPEC\fR\[u2026]

Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-workspace\fR flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
common Unix glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell
accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use
single quotes or double quotes around each pattern.
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR \fIpath\fR

Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fR file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fR file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-locked\fR
.RS 4
Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as when the
existing \fBCargo.lock\fR file was originally generated. Cargo will exit with an
error when either of the following scenarios arises:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'The lock file is missing.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different dependency resolution.
.RE
.sp
It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are desired,
such as in CI pipelines.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fR
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fR(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fR \fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE

Equivalent to specifying both \fB\-\-locked\fR and \fB\-\-offline\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-lockfile\-path\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Changes the path of the lockfile from the default (\fB<workspace_root>/Cargo.lock\fR) to \fIPATH\fR\&. \fIPATH\fR must end with
\fBCargo.lock\fR (e.g. \fB\-\-lockfile\-path /tmp/temporary\-lockfile/Cargo.lock\fR). Note that providing
\fB\-\-lockfile\-path\fR will ignore existing lockfile at the default path, and instead will
either use the lockfile from \fIPATH\fR, or write a new lockfile into the provided \fIPATH\fR if it doesn\[cq]t exist.
This flag can be used to run most commands in read\-only directories, writing lockfile into the provided \fIPATH\fR\&.
.sp
This option is only available on the \fInightly
channel\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html> and

To read this graph, you can follow the chain for each feature from the root
to see why it is included. For example, the \[lq]full\[rq] feature is added by the
\fBrustversion\fR crate which is included from \fBmyproject\fR (with the default
features), and \fBmyproject\fR is the package selected on the command\-line. All
of the other \fBsyn\fR features are added by the \[lq]default\[rq] feature (\[lq]quote\[rq] is
added by \[lq]printing\[rq] and \[lq]proc\-macro\[rq], both of which are default features).
