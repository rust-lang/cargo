cargo\-owner \[em] Manage the owners of a crate on the registry
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo owner\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-add\fR \fIlogin\fR [\fIcrate\fR]
.br
\fBcargo owner\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-remove\fR \fIlogin\fR [\fIcrate\fR]
.br
\fBcargo owner\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fB\-\-list\fR [\fIcrate\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command will modify the owners for a crate on the registry. Owners of a
crate can upload new versions and yank old versions. Non\-team owners can also
modify the set of owners, so take care!
.sp
This command requires you to be authenticated with either the \fB\-\-token\fR option
or using \fBcargo\-login\fR(1).
.sp
If the crate name is not specified, it will use the package name from the
current directory.
.sp
See \fIthe reference\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html#cargo\-owner> for more
information about owners and publishing.

\fB\-\-token\fR \fItoken\fR
.RS 4
API token to use when authenticating. This overrides the token stored in
the credentials file (which is created by \fBcargo\-login\fR(1)).
.sp
\fICargo config\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html> environment variables can be
used to override the tokens stored in the credentials file. The token for
crates.io may be specified with the \fBCARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN\fR environment
variable. Tokens for other registries may be specified with environment
variables of the form \fBCARGO_REGISTRIES_NAME_TOKEN\fR where \fBNAME\fR is the name
of the registry in all capital letters.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-index\fR \fIindex\fR
.RS 4
The URL of the registry index to use.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-registry\fR \fIregistry\fR
.RS 4
Name of the registry to use. Registry names are defined in \fICargo config
files\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&. If not specified, the default registry is used,
which is defined by the \fBregistry.default\fR config key which defaults to
\fBcrates\-io\fR\&.

.sp
\fB\-v\fR, 
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for \[lq]very verbose\[rq] output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fR, 
\fB\-\-quiet\fR

Do not print cargo log messages.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.quiet\fR

.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB+\fR\fItoolchain\fR
.RS 4
If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to \fBcargo\fR
begins with \fB+\fR, it will be interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such
as \fB+stable\fR or \fB+nightly\fR).
See the \fIrustup documentation\fR <https://rust\-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html>
for more information about how toolchain overrides work.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-config\fR \fIKEY=VALUE\fR or \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of \fBKEY=VALUE\fR,
or provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times.
See the \fIcommand\-line overrides section\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command\-line\-overrides> for more information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects
things like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (\fBCargo.toml\fR), as well as
the directories searched for discovering \fB\&.cargo/config.toml\fR, for example. This option must
appear before the command name, for example \fBcargo \-C path/to/my\-project build\fR\&.
.sp
This option is only available on the \fInightly
channel\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html> and
requires the \fB\-Z unstable\-options\fR flag to enable (see
\fI#10098\fR <https://github.com/rust\-lang/cargo/issues/10098>).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h\fR, 
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
