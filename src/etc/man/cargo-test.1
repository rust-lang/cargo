cargo\-test \[em] Execute unit and integration tests of a package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo test\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fItestname\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR \fItest\-options\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compile and execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.
.sp
The test filtering argument \fBTESTNAME\fR and all the arguments following the two
dashes (\fB\-\-\fR) are passed to the test binaries and thus to \fIlibtest\fR (rustc\[cq]s
built in unit\-test and micro\-benchmarking framework).  If you\[cq]re passing
arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after \fB\-\-\fR go to the binary,
the ones before go to Cargo.  For details about libtest\[cq]s arguments see the
output of \fBcargo test \-\- \-\-help\fR and check out the rustc book\[cq]s chapter on
how tests work at <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>\&.
.sp
As an example, this will filter for tests with \fBfoo\fR in their name and run them
on 3 threads in parallel:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
cargo test foo \-\- \-\-test\-threads 3
.fi
.RE
.sp
Tests are built with the \fB\-\-test\fR option to \fBrustc\fR which creates a special
executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable automatically
runs all functions annotated with the \fB#[test]\fR attribute in multiple threads.
\fB#[bench]\fR annotated functions will also be run with one iteration to verify
that they are functional.
.sp
If the package contains multiple test targets, each target compiles to a
special executable as aforementioned, and then is run serially.
.sp
The libtest harness may be disabled by setting \fBharness = false\fR in the target
manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own \fBmain\fR
function to handle running tests.
.SS "Documentation tests"
Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by \fBrustdoc\fR\&. It
extracts code samples from documentation comments of the library target, and
then executes them.
.sp
Different from normal test targets, each code block compiles to a doctest
executable on the fly with \fBrustc\fR\&. These executables run in parallel in
separate processes. The compilation of a code block is in fact a part of test
function controlled by libtest, so some options such as \fB\-\-jobs\fR might not
take effect. Note that this execution model of doctests is not guaranteed
and may change in the future; beware of depending on it.
.sp
See the \fIrustdoc book\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/rustdoc/> for more information
on writing doc tests.
.SS "Working directory of tests"
The working directory when running each unit and integration test is set to the
root directory of the package the test belongs to.
Setting the working directory of tests to the package\[cq]s root directory makes it
possible for tests to reliably access the package\[cq]s files using relative paths,
regardless from where \fBcargo test\fR was executed from.
.sp
For documentation tests, the working directory when invoking \fBrustdoc\fR is set to
the workspace root directory, and is also the directory \fBrustdoc\fR uses as the
compilation directory of each documentation test.
The working directory when running each documentation test is set to the root
directory of the package the test belongs to, and is controlled via \fBrustdoc\fR\[cq]s
\fB\-\-test\-run\-directory\fR option.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Test Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-run\fR
.RS 4
Compile, but don\[cq]t run tests.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-fail\-fast\fR
.RS 4
Run all tests regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will exit
after the first executable fails. The Rust test harness will run all tests
within the executable to completion, this flag only applies to the executable
as a whole.
.RE
.SS "Package Selection"
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fR key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fR), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026], 
\fB\-\-package\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4
Test only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fR(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix
glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell accidentally
expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes or
double quotes around each pattern.

common Unix glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell
accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use
single quotes or double quotes around each pattern.

.RE
.sp
The default behavior can be changed by setting the \fBtest\fR flag for the target
in the manifest settings. Setting examples to \fBtest = true\fR will build and run
the example as a test, replacing the example\[cq]s \fBmain\fR function with the
libtest harness. If you don\[cq]t want the \fBmain\fR function replaced, also include
\fBharness = false\fR, in which case the example will be built and executed as\-is.
.sp
Setting targets to \fBtest = false\fR will stop them from being tested by default.
Target selection options that take a target by name (such as \fB\-\-example foo\fR)
ignore the \fBtest\fR flag and will always test the given target.
.sp
Doc tests for libraries may be disabled by setting \fBdoctest = false\fR for the
library in the manifest.
.sp
See \fIConfiguring a target\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo\-targets.html#configuring\-a\-target>
for more information on per\-target settings.
.sp
Binary targets are automatically built if there is an integration test or
benchmark being selected to test. This allows an integration
test to execute the binary to exercise and test its behavior.
The \fBCARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>\fR
\fIenvironment variable\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment\-variables.html#environment\-variables\-cargo\-sets\-for\-crates>
is set when the integration test is built so that it can use the
\fI\f(BIenv\fI macro\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/std/macro.env.html> to locate the
executable.
.sp
Passing target selection flags will test only the specified
targets.
.sp
Note that \fB\-\-bin\fR, \fB\-\-example\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR and \fB\-\-bench\fR flags also
support common Unix glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your
shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must
use single quotes or double quotes around each glob pattern.
