cargo\-bench \[em] Execute benchmarks of a package
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBcargo bench\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIbenchname\fR] [\fB\-\-\fR \fIbench\-options\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Compile and execute benchmarks.
.sp
The benchmark filtering argument \fIbenchname\fR and all the arguments following
the two dashes (\fB\-\-\fR) are passed to the benchmark binaries and thus to
\fIlibtest\fR (rustc\[cq]s built in unit\-test and micro\-benchmarking framework). If
you are passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after \fB\-\-\fR go
to the binary, the ones before go to Cargo. For details about libtest\[cq]s
arguments see the output of \fBcargo bench \-\- \-\-help\fR and check out the rustc
book\[cq]s chapter on how tests work at
<https://doc.rust\-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html>\&.
.sp
As an example, this will run only the benchmark named \fBfoo\fR (and skip other
similarly named benchmarks like \fBfoobar\fR):
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
cargo bench \-\- foo \-\-exact
.fi
.RE
.sp
Benchmarks are built with the \fB\-\-test\fR option to \fBrustc\fR which creates a
special executable by linking your code with libtest. The executable
automatically runs all functions annotated with the \fB#[bench]\fR attribute.
Cargo passes the \fB\-\-bench\fR flag to the test harness to tell it to run
only benchmarks, regardless of whether the harness is libtest or a custom harness.
.sp
The libtest harness may be disabled by setting \fBharness = false\fR in the target
manifest settings, in which case your code will need to provide its own \fBmain\fR
function to handle running benchmarks.
.RS 3
.ll -5
.sp
\fBNote\fR: The
\fI\f(BI#[bench]\fI attribute\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/nightly/unstable\-book/library\-features/test.html>
is currently unstable and only available on the
\fInightly channel\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/book/appendix\-07\-nightly\-rust.html>\&.
There are some packages available on
\fIcrates.io\fR <https://crates.io/keywords/benchmark> that may help with
running benchmarks on the stable channel, such as
\fICriterion\fR <https://crates.io/crates/criterion>\&.
.br
.RE
.ll
.sp
By default, \fBcargo bench\fR uses the \fI\f(BIbench\fI profile\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#bench>, which enables
optimizations and disables debugging information. If you need to debug a
benchmark, you can use the \fB\-\-profile=dev\fR command\-line option to switch to
the dev profile. You can then run the debug\-enabled benchmark within a
debugger.
.SS "Working directory of benchmarks"
The working directory of every benchmark is set to the root directory of the
package the benchmark belongs to.
Setting the working directory of benchmarks to the package\[cq]s root directory
makes it possible for benchmarks to reliably access the package\[cq]s files using
relative paths, regardless from where \fBcargo bench\fR was executed from.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Benchmark Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-run\fR
.RS 4
Compile, but don\[cq]t run benchmarks.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-fail\-fast\fR
.RS 4
Run all benchmarks regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will exit
after the first executable fails. The Rust test harness will run all benchmarks
within the executable to completion, this flag only applies to the executable
as a whole.
.RE
.SS "Package Selection"
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fR is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fR key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fR), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026], 
\fB\-\-package\fR \fIspec\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4
Benchmark only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fR(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix
glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell accidentally
expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes or
double quotes around each pattern.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-workspace\fR
.RS 4
Benchmark all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\fR
.RS 4
Deprecated alias for \fB\-\-workspace\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fISPEC\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4
Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-workspace\fR flag. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports
common Unix glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your shell
accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use
single quotes or double quotes around each pattern.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
When no target selection options are given, \fBcargo bench\fR will build the
following targets of the selected packages:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'lib \[em] used to link with binaries and benchmarks
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'bins (only if benchmark targets are built and required features are
available)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4

.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'bins as benchmarks
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'benchmark targets
.RE
.sp
The default behavior can be changed by setting the \fBbench\fR flag for the target
in the manifest settings. Setting examples to \fBbench = true\fR will build and
run the example as a benchmark, replacing the example\[cq]s \fBmain\fR function with
the libtest harness.
.sp
Setting targets to \fBbench = false\fR will stop them from being benchmarked by
default. Target selection options that take a target by name (such as
\fB\-\-example foo\fR) ignore the \fBbench\fR flag and will always benchmark the given
target.
.sp
See \fIConfiguring a target\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo\-targets.html#configuring\-a\-target>
for more information on per\-target settings.
.sp
Binary targets are automatically built if there is an integration test or
benchmark being selected to benchmark. This allows an integration
test to execute the binary to exercise and test its behavior.
The \fBCARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>\fR
\fIenvironment variable\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment\-variables.html#environment\-variables\-cargo\-sets\-for\-crates>
is set when the integration test is built so that it can use the
\fI\f(BIenv\fI macro\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/std/macro.env.html> to locate the
executable.
.sp
Passing target selection flags will benchmark only the specified
targets.
.sp
Note that \fB\-\-bin\fR, \fB\-\-example\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR and \fB\-\-bench\fR flags also
support common Unix glob patterns like \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR and \fB[]\fR\&. However, to avoid your
shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must
use single quotes or double quotes around each glob pattern.
.sp
\fB\-\-lib\fR

multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-tests\fR
.RS 4
Benchmark all targets that have the \fBtest = true\fR manifest
flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries, integration tests, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBtest\fR flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bench\fR \fIname\fR\[u2026]
.RS 4

times and supports common Unix glob patterns.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-benches\fR
.RS 4
Benchmark all targets that have the \fBbench = true\fR
manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built
as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \fBbench\fR flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-targets\fR

.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When no
feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fR feature is activated for every
selected package.

.sp
\fB\-F\fR \fIfeatures\fR, 
\fB\-\-features\fR \fIfeatures\fR

members may be enabled with \fBpackage\-name/feature\-name\fR syntax. This flag may
be specified multiple times, which enables all specified features.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fR
.RS 4

.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fR \fItriple\fR
.RS 4
Benchmark for the given architecture. The default is the host architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fR\&. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fR for a
list of supported targets. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fR
\fIconfig value\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode where the
target artifacts are placed in a separate directory. See the
\fIbuild cache\fR <https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/build\-cache.html> documentation for more details.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-profile\fR \fIname\fR

.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-timings=\fR\fIfmts\fR

Output information how long each compilation takes, and track concurrency
information over time. Accepts an optional comma\-separated list of output
formats; \fB\-\-timings\fR without an argument will default to \fB\-\-timings=html\fR\&.
Specifying an output format (rather than the default) is unstable and requires
\fB\-Zunstable\-options\fR\&. Valid output formats:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\fBhtml\fR (unstable, requires \fB\-Zunstable\-options\fR): Write a human\-readable file \fBcargo\-timing.html\fR to the
\fBtarget/cargo\-timings\fR directory with a report of the compilation. Also write
a report to the same directory with a timestamp in the filename if you want
to look at older runs. HTML output is suitable for human consumption only,
and does not provide machine\-readable timing data.

Defaults to \fBtarget\fR in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
By default the Rust test harness hides output from benchmark execution to keep
results readable. Benchmark output can be recovered (e.g., for debugging) by
passing \fB\-\-nocapture\fR to the benchmark binaries:

\fBCargo.lock\fR (e.g. \fB\-\-lockfile\-path /tmp/temporary\-lockfile/Cargo.lock\fR). Note that providing
\fB\-\-lockfile\-path\fR will ignore existing lockfile at the default path, and instead will
either use the lockfile from \fIPATH\fR, or write a new lockfile into the provided \fIPATH\fR if it doesn\[cq]t exist.
This flag can be used to run most commands in read\-only directories, writing lockfile into the provided \fIPATH\fR\&.
