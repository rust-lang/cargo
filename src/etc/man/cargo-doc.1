.SH "NAME"
cargo\-doc \- Build a package\(aqs documentation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcargo doc [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Build the documentation for the local package and all dependencies. The output
is placed in \fBtarget/doc\fP in rustdoc\(cqs usual format.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Documentation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-open\fP
.RS 4
Open the docs in a browser after building them.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-deps\fP
.RS 4
Do not build documentation for dependencies.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-document\-private\-items\fP
.RS 4
Include non\-public items in the documentation.
.RE
.SS "Package Selection"
.sp
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\fBworkspace.default\-members\fP key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\fB\-\-workspace\fP), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fP \fISPEC\fP..., \fB\-\-package\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Document only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fP(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-workspace\fP
.RS 4
Document all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated alias for \fB\-\-workspace\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-workspace\fP flag. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
.sp
When no target selection options are given, \fBcargo doc\fP will document all
binary and library targets of the selected package. The binary will be skipped
if its name is the same as the lib target. Binaries are skipped if they have
\fBrequired\-features\fP that are missing.
.sp
The default behavior can be changed by setting \fBdoc = false\fP for the target in
the manifest settings. Using target selection options will ignore the \fBdoc\fP
flag and will always document the given target.
.sp
\fB\-\-lib\fP
.RS 4
Document the package\(cqs library.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Document the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bins\fP
.RS 4
Document all binary targets.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \fBdefault\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \fB<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \fBdefault\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Document for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\fB<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \fBrustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \fBbuild.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-release\fP
.RS 4
Document optimized artifacts with the \fBrelease\fP profile. See the
PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile selection.
.RE
.SS "Output Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \fBCARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\fBbuild.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \fBtarget\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \fBterm.verbose\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
.RS 4

.el \{\

\fBjson\-diagnostic\-short\fP: Ensure the \fBrendered\fP field of JSON messages contains
the "short" rendering from rustc.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

\fBjson\-render\-diagnostics\fP: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc diagnostics in
in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself should render the
JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo\(cqs own JSON diagnostics and others
coming from rustc are still emitted.
.RE
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \fBCargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches for the
\fBCargo.toml\fP file in the current directory or any parent directory.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \fBCargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \fB\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\fBCargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \fBnet.offline\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Prints help information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-Z\fP \fIFLAG\fP...
.RS 4
Unstable (nightly\-only) flags to Cargo. Run \fBcargo \-Z help\fP for
details.
.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fP \fIN\fP, \fB\-\-jobs\fP \fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\fBbuild.jobs\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SH "PROFILES"
.sp
Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See
\c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the\-profile\-sections" "the reference"
for more details.
.sp
Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
\fBdev\fP or \fBtest\fP profiles are used. If the \fB\-\-release\fP flag is given, then the
\fBrelease\fP or \fBbench\fP profiles are used.
